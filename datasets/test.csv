0,stan,i love you more than you'll ever know,Jazz,en,"If I ever leave you
You can say I told you so
If I ever hurt you baby
You know I hurt myself as well

Is that any way for a man to carry on
You think he wants
His little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

When I wasn't making too much money
You knew where my paycheck went
You know I brought it home to baby
And I never spent one red cent

Is that any way for a man to carry on
You think he wants
His little loved one gone
I love you baby
More than you'll ever know
More than you'll ever know

I'm not trying to be any kinds of a man
I'm trying to be somebody
You can love trust and understand
I know that I could be yeah a part of you
That no one else could see
I just got to hear you say
It's alright yeah yeah yeah

I'm only flesh and blood
But I could be everything
That you demand
I could be president
Of General Motors baby huh
Or just a tiny little grain of sand

Is that any way for a man to carry on
You think he wants
His little loved one gone
I love you baby, I love you baby
I love you more than you will ever know"
1,the soft boys,vegetable man [*],Rock,en,"In leather shoes
I get the blues
So I walk the streets
In my plastic feet
And my blue velvet trousers make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink about blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt I look a jerk
And my turquoise waistcoat is quite outta sight
But oh, woah, my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man, where are you?

So I change my hair
And I buy my jeans
And I cover them up with a lettuce cup
My pants and socks with water and epoxy
Don't take long about my old socks
We'll wash my watch with a plant base, outta date, 
In a little hole there all alone
It's what I got
It's what I wear
It's what you see
It must be me
It's what I am
Vegetable man

Ah-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-oh

I've been looking all over the place for a place for me
But it ain't anywhere
It just ain't anywhere

Vegetable man
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
Vegetable man

Vegetable, vegetable man

He's the kind of fellow you've just got to see if you can

And body too
Keep missin' you
What am I to do
The day's so long
And the night's so rough
;Cause it seems like I
Can't forget your love
It feels just like
I'm gonna fall apart
And I don't know how
I can make it now ...so

Come back
You've been gone too long
You're on my mind
And it's hard to carry on 
Come back
You've been away too long
My heart is weak
From being strong

I thought my sad face
Would make you stay
And it took me out
When you left that day
I sit and stare
But no one's there
In the room outside
That we used to share
When you're not here
It's a quiet place
It's a lonely house
Just an empty space ...you gotta

Come back
You've been gone too long
You're all I need
And it's hard to carry on
Come back
You been away too long
My heart is weak
From being strong
Come back
You've been gone so long

And I betcha I can show you
Come back

Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you yeah

To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you
{Chorus}
I just wanna touch u baby
I just wanna kiss u girl
I just wanna touch u
Cuz u give me butterflies inside,

All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies inside

If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you

10,venom,schizo,Metal,en,"Children gather round him,
Mystery surrounds him,
What terrible secret does he hide,
An ordinary man,
Doing what he can,
But what goes on inside his mind.

The night draws nigh,
With darkened sky's,
Axe blade shines,
Midnight chimes.

Morning comes around,
Headless bodies found,
Our little friend just sits and smiles ha ha,
Take them home and love them,
Read the bible to them,
Be sure to kiss each one goodnight.

But come the night,
You'll freeze with fright,
Axe drawn high,
Another dies.

Creeping and searching for victims unknowing,
What fate doth await round each corner,
The take in the night,
He's got you in his sight.

Now that I have warned you,
Always look behind you,
You'll never know just who'll be there,
That harmless looking dear,
May be the one to fear,
So never trust those you don't know.

But come the night,
You'll freeze with fright,
Axe drawn high,
The bastards die."

They gave me sixth man of the year, came off the bench for Tha Liks
Shot the lights out at the championship
Big chips, big trips, new fits, my money clip's
full of green cheese, my other pocket got green weed
Rap niggaz, we different individuals
Elevate the level of the music and the visuals
It's do or die, I need a +Priest+, call +Superfly+
Whatever we discuss when we meet's between you and I
I'm truly high, red-eyed for the red-eye flight
Five hours, eight drinks, I rode all night, shit
Everyday, every night's a saloon
Crime blitty, good bottle, million dollar tunes

Love when when you're out there on the ave
When you're down 24/7, niggaz don't know the half

I be coastin and be coastin, hittin three wheel motion
with my rimz and tirez

of catchin three to the back, and try walkin with that (yeah!)
I ain't goin to the pen for shit, except to snatch up
my loved ones to get loose and hop the fence
It ain't hard to look hard, snatch up a catalogue
Mad dog to niggaz that walk up your boulevard (yeah!)
But one day, you gon' feel it (what?)
I'm a firm believer in the theory if it bleeds, I can kill it
A hit man for hire (yeah!) caught up in the crossfire

He took me to a spot in Long Beach, hooked me up with four pumps
(bzzt) but everybody in the hood can't jump (bzzt)
And I change colors when the sun hit me
Fix me up, now my owner want to slang me for 50?
Bling bling, now I belong to a Japanese
And they was quick to throw me in the magazines
I make money (huh?) I never broke down, fools trippin
(Check it out) How many cars you see in Seoul on streets dippin?

Looking for love but no one stays around
The worlds on fire, it's so cold right right now
In her head, in her bed
She told her mama don't worry, papa don't preach
She only need knowledge to help her get sleep
Throw some syrup in the red cup
Watch she blowing on that cannabis

She's just fading away
She's just fading away
Sleep with that purple by her side
Now she's seeing strobe light
Her last man did her wrong
And he left her mind gone
She's just fading away
Till she's gone like a memory

He's gonna go broke from selling dreams
Before she overdosed off of his amphetamine
Feeling none of the things that she felt before
Wonder what will it be like at times she never thought
Someone is asking questions so deep
Six feet under but can't rest in peace
And they calling out for her but she's out of reach
Nobody wants to ?, that's already been ?
And right now the highs are controlling the lows

She's just fading away
She's just fading away
Sleep with that purple by her side
Now she's seeing strobe light
Her last man did her wrong
And he left her mind gone
She's just fading away
Till she's gone like a memory

She's so gone, she's so far away
In a cold ass cell on the right side of heartbreak
Just like the autumn leaves fall, April brings the rain
Separation slices like a blade, but only generates the pain
How could something so clear become so vein

She's just fading away
She's just fading away
Sleep with that purple by her side
Now she's seeing strobe light
Her last man did her wrong
And he left her mind gone
She's just fading away
Till she's gone like a memory"

Trimmed with antique luxury

She always makes you welcome in
Cats and babies 'round her feet
And all are fat and none are thin
None are thin and all are fat
She may bake some brownies today
Saying, you are welcome back
She is another canyon lady
Estrella circus girl
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls
Songs like tiny hammers hurled
At beveled mirrors in empty halls
Empty halls and beveled mirrors
Sailing seas and climbing banyans
Come out for a visit here
To be a lady of the canyon
Trina takes her paints and her threads
And she weaves a pattern all her own
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads
And she gathers flowers for her home
For her home she gathers flowers
And Estrella, dear companion
Colors up the sunshine hours
Pouring music down the canyon-
Coloring the sunshine hours
They are the ladies of the canyon."

You fuck around leave your body in the lost and found
How you like me now?
We got the industry on lock
The world is on shock
I'm a take a piece of the rock
Yo, you feel it in the heart when we took you to the park
Midnight after dark, I'm the raider of the lost ark

Now na na na na na na, nana nah
Super size, super size, right before your eyes
I bring in treats like giant sweet potato pies
Wise, sword shift and I spit on flies
Killing all the tips from studio spies
Head to bed, beddie bye, beddie bye
Don't ask why, we'll take your ass to paradise
Flipmode's the Squad don't test, don't try

Peace to my outer space ties

Bigger than crack in the 80's
Drive the buggy I Mercedes
Blow up like C-4

Can't play the game no more
Pick up the cain no more

Get yourself caught up

Leave cities in carnage
Pretty as farmers that pour whiskey at harvest and hold 16 bananas

Try on this, you can't see me like vagina lips
Smugglin diamond chips, bubblin anonymous

Are making ? ? of my brown girl If the king of spain would Go abroad with his assembled men I would flatten grass and rank grass And I would be with my brown girl Buying cows at the fair If I were ? and my brown girl Go and come first love Until we go over to gaoth-bearra Until we separate from each other The tops of the branches and the swan From the waves ? That won't separate us And it's only folly for you to put it ? ? I wrote a letter To my sweetheart and a sharp complaint She sent it back to me That her heart was inside me. Compose the artsswannoble person ? Finer than silk or bird feathers Heavy is my sigh When I think of being apart from her. What I heard on Sunday As conversation among the women That she was going to be married To a young man from the place. Sweetheart take my advice And this autumn stay as you are And don't tell anyone, my love, That you are my love."

It was the sound when the hit the ground runnin'
You were out for blood
And I was still tapped out from the battle before

I remember the smell in the room
It was a bad tattoo, like cheap perfume
Waiting with the windows open
Just hoping that the sun breaks through for a moment

Days turned to weeks, months into a year
I gotta bring up all the things that I want her to hear
Then the same old pat on the back
It all work out and everything will be alright

Losing sight of reality
While losing the fight to try to forget
All I have are the memories of every single word you said
Every single word you said

I remember that day
Everything changed
I remember that day
That image never fades away
I remember that day
Something died inside of me
I remember that day
That everything changed

It wasn't just a senseless situation
No sense of making something out of nothing now
I know it would be pointless at this point
In time to point out any problems now

Are you forgetting that rumors and reputation
Don't help your situation
When all you have to show the world
Is how you act out your problems, like a little girl 

And if memory serves me right
You were serving up nothing but a plate of lies
And it was covered in flies
Rotten from the inside out
Excuse my words as I put it in my mouth

Yeah, losing sight of reality
While losing the fight to try to forget
All I have are the memories of every single word you said
Every single word you said

I remember that day

I remember that day
Something died inside of me
I remember that day

You say I have a problem now
I think we have a problem here
You say I have a problem now
I say there is no way for us out of here

Aggravated, spare for days
I troll downtown the red light place
Jump up bubble up, what's in store
Love is the drug and I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl where beat goes on
Stitched up tight, can't shake free
Love is the drug, got a hook on me
Oh oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh oh can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Late that night I park my car
Stake my place in the singles bar
Face to face, toe to toe
Heart to heart as we hit the floor
Lumber up, limbo down
The locked embrace, the stumble round
I say go, she say yes
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest
Oh oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh oh can't you see
Love is the drug, got a hook in me
Oh oh catch that buzz
Love is the drug I'm thinking of
Oh oh can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Love is, love is, love is the drug"

searching for an inner clout
may not take another bout
honey in the hale could fill the pales of loving less with vain

aiming and it sunk and we were drunk and we had fleshed it out

Thinking, that this house once a home

Falling, for a hundred million miles
Shattered and broken, like a hundred million tiles
And there is something, there is something in my eyes

Come take a walk with me down
The trail of tears
Where legions have walked before

No one is ever alone
On this trail of tears
You're always at home

Listen to these words you'll never hear
We had perfection, and than you just disappeared
Now my eyes are burning, from trying to find you here
And fighting back the tears

Come take a walk with me down
The trail of tears
Where legions have walked before

No one is ever alone
On this trail of tears

Together we can be okay
If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

Don't know where to begin, just couple of kids
When we met by a bar on the side of the road
It was only a dream, saw you staring at me
What i said to myself as I woke up to see
It was already late 10:10 in the neon green
And your number was on my right hand in red ink

Before we live forever say
Together we can be okay
If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

Seven years will go by in a blink of an eye
Suddenly here we are, thinking what are the odds
Born on opposite coasts for the two of us both
Knowing in 20 years we would not be alone
Might have made us a pair of zen-like two-year-olds
With a couple of ring pops no need to propose

Before we live forever say
Together we can be okay
If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

And in seventy years when somehow there's a way
To be frozen in time forever we will stay

Before we live forever say
Together we can be okay
If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

If it's the last thing that we do
I wanna sing along with you

And hear you singing too
This is our song
I'll always song for you"

Bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl
But money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee
Cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make yo pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
double cup love
You the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo pheen on
Yea just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back

All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been.

Old age is golden so I've heard said
But sometimes I wonder as I crawl into bed
With my ears in a drawer, my teeth in a cup
My eyes on the table until I wake up.
As sleep dims my vision I say to myself:
Is there anything else I should lay on the shelf?
But though nations are warring and business is vexed
I'll stick around to see what happens next.

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been.

When I was young my slippers were red,
I could kick up my heels right over my head.
When I was older my slippers were blue,
But still I could dance the whole night thru.
Now I am older my slippers are black,
I huff to the store and I puff my way back.
But never you laugh; I don't mind at all,
I'd rather be huffing than not puff at all.

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been.

I get up each morning and dust off my wits
Open the paper and read the obits
If I'm not there I know I'm not dead
So I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed.

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been."

Used to be one of a kind
Something great in mind

One step back...

Sailing through the wide blue yonder

Like a bird that's flying homeward

Over plains and high dark mountains
Over rivers deep and wide
Carrying mail to California

Watch her circle for the landing
Hear her moan and cough and sigh
Now she's coming down the runway

Gaze into the wall of these restless souls
Eternally, lost in fear of your
Godforsaken son

That dove of life has died
Paralyzed and terrorized
By the fear you feel inside
Caught within the floods of blood

Tell you to cross your heart and hope to die (hope to die)

You know you lie, you know you lie to me

You should hear the things that you say
Wish I could run back on a replay (on a replay)
Think you might of lost your mind, boy you crazy
Baby I wasn't born yesterday
Never ask for your diamonds and pearls
Sure is nice, but you sleeping with another girl
I'm sittin home like I'm waitin on my turn
You runnin game baby, when will you learn
That all I ever wanted from you is for you
To say you love me and it to be true, but
(Chorus)

Boy you know you tell me anything
It's written on your face
You lying and I can see
I'm not the type to react off of jealousy
And all I hear you say is baby believe me
Ain't like I'm going through your pockets, through your phone or like I call you twenty times
When you leave me at home
All I ever wanted from you is for you
To say you love me and it to be true

Truth is, sometimes I'm like Jim Carey
Honestly, I got other girls in my blackberry
Scouts honor, that's my mama who had texted me
Yeah I know read it, my mama she think I'm sexy
Ok, ok, ok I'm caught up
What are you, like a detective
I feel like I'm locked up
Look at it from my perspective, why you always hop up
When my phone ringing and a known number pop up
(Hello) Can I get that back, you know you dirty
You crooked baby, you 3:30
And I swear I'm 6:00 with you, even earlier
Lightning can't strike twice, right
You believe me girlie

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

Once in a blue moon you might find a job
Sleep in the rain, you sleep in the snow
When the beds are all taken 
You've got nowhere to go

Well I can see me now, 
I'm back there on the dance floor
Oh with a blonde on me arm, red-head to spare
Spit on my shoes and shine in me hair

Motorbike ride in the mid-day heat.
Dust that hung from the desert skies -
Run though we'd run, it still burned our eyes.

Oh yes, we may walk on the wild, wild side of life.
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side.
In the shadows of a promise you can take my hand,
And show me a way to understand.

So if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you know what I need,
And if you really, really want me to stay,
You've got to lead the way.
Yes if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you can stand by me,
And if you really, really want me to stay,
You've got to lead the way.

Reckless night in a nameless town,
Then we moved out of sight with a silent sound.
A beach that wept, the deserted waves -
That's where we slept, knowing we'd be safe.

Now you may think you can walk on the wild, wild side with me.
But there's a lot I can learn and a lot I'd get to see.
I know you've got my life lying in your hands,
It's up to you to make me understand.

So if you think you know how to love me,
And you think you know what I need,
And if you really, really want me to stay,
You've got to lead the way.

But though the phantoms of this place want to steal away your grace I'll sleep beside you through the cold i will not leave you here And in this silence I can hear all the fury and the fear but i promise you my love I will not leave you here For I will bury you Where they bury me But the emptiness is filled and the hatred reconciled with a daily struggle to forget. Beyond frustration and contempt is the pain of heaven spent by those ignorant and cold; at your expense. I see, I see, I see we move with the water I feel, I feel, I feel this darkness receding I see, I see, I see we flow like the ocean I feel, I feel, Oh God I don't think I'm breathing."

With the radio on and the books she read
Let the truth be known
I just wanna date a surfer babe
I hope I’m not a little too late
I never know what your gonna say
You don’t think you’re my type
But you are, but you are, but you are, but you are
You know
I just don’t know how I’m gonna get through
This thing that I’ve been feeling for you
Don’t think I know your name
But I do, but I do, but I do
You’re a Surfer Babe!
Well you better get home
‘Coz your dad is awake
Said he saw you last nigth making out by the lake
With a boy that he hates
He doesn’t look at me the same way that you do
Said I look pretty cute but I don’t got the grades
Seen the star on my foot and the way I behave
And we’re better off when daddy’s not around
Oh baby you, got nothing to prove
But if we decide to go
Doesn’t mean he’s gotta know
Oh baby you, got nothing to prove
And we’re better off when daddy’s outta of town
Went out with the guys
And before my eyes
There was this girl and she looked so fine
And she blew my mind
And I wish that she was mine
And I said ‘hey wait up ‘coz I’m off to speak to her’
And my friends said
(You’ll never get her, you’ll never gonna get that girl)

Coz I loved her long blonde hair
And love was in the air
And she looked at me
And the rest was history
Dude, you’re being silly ‘Coz you’re never gonna get that girl
And you’re never gonna get that girl
We spoke for hours
Took off my trousers
Spent the day laughing in the sun
And we had fun
And my friends they all looked stunned
Dude she’s amazing and I can’t believe you got that girl

I dug the book she read
How can I forget

And I can’t believe you got that girl

Just turned 17
I guess my friends were right
She’s outta my league
So what am I to do
She’s too good to be true
But three days later
Went round to see her
But she was with another guy
And I said fine
But I’ll never ask her why
And since then loneliness
Has been a friend of mine
And my friends say
(Such a pity, I’m sorry that you lost that girl)
I let her slip away
They tell me everyday
That it will be okay
Coz she rocked my world
More than any other girl
Dude, it’s such a pity and
I’m sorry that you lost that girl
And I’m sorry that you lost that..

It’s the death of my first dog,
It’s the angels up above me,
It’s the song that they don’t sing,
It’s a little bit of everything.”
An older man stands in a buffet line,
He is smiling and holding out his plate,
And the further he looks back into his timeline,
That hard road always had led him to today,
And making up for when his bright future had left him,
Making up for the fact that his only son is gone,
And letting everything out once, His server asks him,
Have you figured out yet, what it is you want?
I want a little bit of everything,
The biscuits and the beans,
Whatever helps me to forget about
The things that brought me to my knees,
So pile on those mashed potatoes,
And an extra chicken wing,
I’m having a little bit of everything.
Somewhere a pretty girl is writing invitations,
To a wedding she has scheduled for the fall,
Her man says, “Baby, can I make an observation?
You don’t seem to be having any fun at all.”
She said, “You just worry about your groomsmen and your shirt-size,
And rest assured that this is making me feel good,
I think that love is so much easier than you realize,
If you can give yourself to someone,
Then you should.
Cause it’s a little bit of everything,
The way you choke, the way you ache,
It is waking up before you,
So I can watch you as you wake.
So in the day in late September,
It’s not some stupid little ring,
I’m giving a little bit of everything.
Oh, it’s a little bit of everything,
It’s the matador and the bull,
It’s the suggested daily dosage,
It is the red moon when it’s full.
All these psychics and these doctors,
They’re all right and they’re all wrong,
It’s like trying to make out every word,
When they should simply hum along,
It’s not some message written in the dark,
Or some truth that no one’s seen,
It’s a little bit of everything."

She would tell him when,
They'd fool around and fool around
And then they'd kiss again.

I went straight for the course

With burns on the backs of my palms
Will I regret my cause? or revel in my thoughts?
I'm caught in the winds of remorse
'Cause everybody knows

What good is a sword, next to a shotgun
What good is a sword, next to a shotgun
What good is a sword, next to a shotgun

How did I get stuck in this valiant position
When either I'll survive for an instant
Or cradle the earth?
My God forsaken, weakened pulse, I knew I had to amend this
Though I never was a force to be reckoned, or
A sight to behold

Will I regret my cause? or revel in my thoughts?

Yeah, beats like this you just can't peep
It's a natural, international, not that same ol' shit
Get split in half, figuratively speaking take a bloodbath
When I run past MC's, drop the mic like the Sunsplash
Is in Jamaica, the heart-breaka lyrics
Like a stake through your left pectoral your shit is horrible
I'm clean, like brand new Mo-Mo's on a Porsche
And your shit is sittin on rims, let me begin
To elaborate, rings on his hands like each finger was Saturn
And the latest fashions but the same patterns
Kept flashin up in his rap, concerned with, glamorous
Tales of fatalities like he was Tarantino
The analogy is that we know that Quentin write Fiction
Fantasies, woven intricately, while I'm predicting
Every motion, them slight changes in your tone of voice
Is a toast to your parasitic choice of speak
Leakin cold blood out the arteries if you bit
'Cause we done said it, you can't configurate
Like the great Hieroglyphics resistance we incinerate
Lit it up, now I'm fin to cut
Peep the demonstration of uniqueness

It could be fatal wait'll Del come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll O come back out, and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts

Hurrah, here come Del to dispel the blahs
Cause and effect, pause for respect collection
Diction friction, depicting violence
Volatile with my profile, like Molotov's
MC's must be on auto-pilot, waddle silent
Like some platypuses, Del is down with data pushers
With top secret floppy disk and battle armor and mega
Plus all the rhymes that I'm bangin are double-decker, to check ya

Electri-fying, defying laws of gravity (what?)
Avidly rapidly firing lyrics I'm shattering
The abdominal cavity, then I'm travelling out the spinal
Finalizing your paralysis on the microphone (what?)
The catalyst is the capital L-I-N-D-S-E-why
MC's try to test but they mind gets blown

Wait'll O come back out, and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts

Ain't no MC hurtin me, matter of fact you work for me
Havoc stricken palladiums made me numb
To anything you speak to desecrate the great Hieroglyphics
And with it goes the flows that chop egos, to segments
Behind the decimal points, I point backwards
When you lack words you toil but boil I coil clowns
All around, repellin sellin statues of wack groups
Statues for Hieroglyphic travellers
Any lackluster MC's I mallux ya, right on your cranium crack it
Bust your teeth through your limbs and then tip you over
If you know of Del, well then
I ill constantly with consonants, followed by nouns and make
Mounds of manuscripts to whip challengers, that ain't
Too talented, so before I reach my destintation
Let's waste some MC's for fun (yeah)
I understand the fans needs so I feed em smorgasboards
So they can gorge and MC's can gouge they eyes out, from the teargas
Emitted from my tongue, leaving fans sprung
And for the crews who high-strung, eat dung (ewww)
They just gnats and ticks, bugging me (bzzzzzzz)
Hugging me nuts in a cuddly clutch, my
Hieroglyphic theory is validated by facts
Dilated the tracks, so they wide and fat
Violated the wax, but colonized the wise words
With more enzymes ten times nutritional
Unintentional, my flows just go there, yeah

Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll Op come back out and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal
Wait'll Del come back out and act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal wait'll Souls come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts
Don't you ever forget, it could be fatal wait'll ? come back out
And act out emotions in Oakland Blackouts

These words he did say as I boldly walked by
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story

Once in the saddle I used to go gay
First down to Rosie's and then to the card house
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today

Get sixteen gamblers to carry my coffin
Get six jolly cowboys to sing me a song
Take me to the graveyard and lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song
Take me to the valley and lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy, I know I've done wrong

Oh beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Play the Dead March as they carry me along
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin
Put roses to deaden the clods as they fall

And once I traveled winter with the sun
Your heart was my home,

Fixed fate with steely eyes told her it was not the time for me,

Always rise and then fall,
But now its dead and I'm done,
And I won't cry for you no more

I the lonely captive stand with only memories to hold my hand,
But I'd not change a single thing twas the best and worst of time,
Beneath the yellow clouded moon,
Where buried hopes rise from their tombs,
The whispers call to heaven above,
That you caught me up in the windy arms of love
That you caught me up in the windy arms of love

Back into a cloud

That I let all these years go by

Open a door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

Yeah

Now the days have grown
To years of feeling all alone
As she sits and wonders if all she's doin' is wrong
Cos lately she'd try anything just to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she'd say, if she'd say

Buy me a rose
Call me from work
Open the door for me what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things
I need the most in my life

And the more that he lives
The less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives
The more that he sees
This is the story of you
And me

So I bought you a rose
On the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hoped you noticed this look in my eyes
Cause im gonna make things right
For the rest of your life(rest of your life)
And I'm gonna hold you tonight, tonight

Deep inside hides a lie
Where can we try to seek
A way so this will die
Innocence died when they took his mind
And they tried to leave him behind
Not even a cascade of tears will save you
And keep you away from harm
Concinnity of destiny
Is not what you wished it to be
Deep inside hides a lie
Where can we try to seek
A way so this will die
Blinded by love
Between lust and hate
You scarred your fate
There's no time to waste

Death and robberies 
On the dark blocks where bodies bleed

Kids play where heat sprays
Straight floods, no love, fake thugs
Draw blood with Four-Four snubs
Tear away your rug
Kids with clout 
Up in the Range Rover with chicks, spray in their mouth
Drain 'em out, set up for the wet up, bang 'em out
These streets in Queens remain the murder scene, blood stain 'em out

Verse 1: (Kool G. Rap)
Inside the chambers of Hell
Where all the L puffin' niggas dwell
And fell 'cause of a loss of blood cells
Bullet shells, glass is shattered
Shit gets torn and tattered
Niggas brains is splattered on sewage drains when they be goin' at it
Static over addicts, revolvers and automatics 
It's illmatic how I seen one catch two in the cabbage
From an initial, official shiny nickel played pistols
Sparklin' like crystals, launchin' missiles
Domes get blown like whistles
Ain't no jokin', niggas will leave you and your Momma soakin'
And smokin' and blown open
Bodies found in Hoboken
Kids comittin' murder after murder
Shit is real so I feel for the ones that don't pack steel and burners
Bodies be droppin' down around Queens 
By different teams, it's the Teens that tear your ass out the frame by
The seams
The end of the drama center, niggas you want drama?
Word to Momma come equipped with two clips and body armor.

Jigged out, wig spinned out with waves
Pockets full of the Franklins, I stay gettin' paid
Stay stackin' papes, plus my Fam flip cakes
While some of us rap, other fellas flip 'caine
Rock big chains, what ya'll think this a game?
Murder incorp. slash open cases with cartels
We do things that make the Mob tell
The way we go outta state and flip more cakes then Carvel
Ya'll play the cut, and watch this lil' nigga prevail
'cause I spit much hotter than Hell
So why ya'll playa hate and plot to creep on mine
I pay ya'll no mind, but violate and speak to the Nine
I'm a B.K. Son of a gun 
When I spit 16 bars ya'll rap niggas dial 911
I'm only 14, and ya'll rap dudes ready to run
This ain't a game, ain't no time for fun
I'm the young rap Lord, so I gotta hold it down
It's Easy Mo Bee, G. Rap and Jinx Da Juvenile. 

Verse 3: (Kool G. Rap)
Crushed with the ice, get rushed for your life
Busted in twice, stuck with a knife
On these rough nights we hustle and heist
Put heaters to your Man and double the price
Snuffin' your lights, shake you like a couple of dice
Nothin' is nice, prepare for combat
Firearm cats with long gats, end up where you get embalmed at
Lay on the floor flat, pull the gat format
Direct beside your door mat 
Cock the Fours back, blow out your Whore's back
Leave the kids wigs tore back
My niggas ride with me like horseback
Go to war rats, niggas you strapped? let me take that 
G. Rap face slap all of these fake cats
And unofficials, get gun missiles clapped in your lung tissue
Me and my Dun's'll hit you, slugs not even one'll miss you
Tons of pistols 
Kid, you got guns?, you should've brung 'em wit' you
Them niggas runnin' wit' you
Caught 'em and hung 'em wit' you
No games, out to blow frames with Fo' flames
At close range, have all you niggas lookin' for Rogaine.

Or a sly touch at times
I don't think it
Meant anything to you

So I open the door
It's the 'friend'

In the hallway
'Please sit down'
A candlelit shadow
On a wall near the bed

You know I hate to ask
But are 'friends' electric?
Only mine's broke down
And now I've no-one to love

So I found out
Your reasons
For the phone calls
And smiles
And it hurts
And I'm lonely
And I should never
Have tried
And I missed you tonight
It must be time to leave
You see it meant
Everything to me

Being learned by other spies for their information

218,okkervil river,call yourself renee,Indie,en,"Don't look back until you realise you're pointedly not trying to look back
Then reconsider trying for a clearer mind, try for a grace of some kind
Leave your house and walk in the autumn light
Imagine a river, massive and galloping beneath your feet
Or you can call yourself Renee again and you can move back to Rapid City

You live in a hotel, you wait for a phone call, you wait for an email
You look out the window at a tree, weighted down with snow
You worry about your mother, you watch a couple movies, you take an Ativan
You walk down a Rapid City street alone
And at night there's a pink cast underneath the blank grey cloud head
Well it's something pretty to look at in the sky
And I don't know why so-and-so's taking much time to breathe something new into my life
And there's a tip-tap on the window that could be Fate's pale face looking in
Energy could be in the trembling hands of a tree, or it could be lighter
Could be nothing at all

Out in the night
The world was right against our skin
And it was right again
Out in the night
The world was right against our skin
And it was right, baby

Mysteriously absent for the afternoon and suddenly missing for a full month
His mother called up, called around the corner, called out shivering from a dream
Called his father five states to the south, said he was gone
When he could have easily been seen in a Vero Beach Dillard's
Weaving in and out of the racks of beautiful blue men's shirts
Or in South Florida, breezing through the drive-through, easy like a song on the stereo
Letting it all slide like an easy-going god
Or he could have not existed, just a vision of his mother
When she wished it so hard into something she could almost see
Or he could have been a feeling in the air, or the guy who cuts your hair
He could have been anyone, he could even have been me

And me, I don't care if I come back as a single wave
Or an oriole on a spell branch on a tree
Cause I'm not scared to die as long as I know 
that the universe has something really to do with me

Out in the night
The air was right against our skin
And it was right
Out in the night
The air was right against our skin
And it was right, baby

I wanna make it nice again
I wanna make it alright
I wanna make it nice again
I wanna make it alright

Out in the night
The world was right against our skin
And it was alright, child
Out in the night
The world was right against our skin
And it was alright, baby

I wanna make it nice again
I wanna make it alright"

Can't hold back  just let it flow 

If you want me 

And I just want to make you see 

Here is where you want to be 

If you want me

Cause I don't feel your arms holding me 

And when it gets cold at night 

And my body is warm 

Don't you know that I'm all that you need

Whenever you want me to 

And anything that you ask 

I would do 

And baby I hope you understand 

That I got feelings 

When all of my feelings are just being used

How could you take one step from the life we built
And not want to turn around
We can scream, we can fight
We can spend the night sleeping in separate rooms
Checkmate baby, waiting on the next move
But it ain't about winning or losing

I'll keep my heart wide open
Take a bullet, take the blame
Anything for you, you
And I would chase every dream you can dream of
Ain't a part of me I wouldn't give up for you, you
Through the fire and the rain
You're the one my heart keeps chasing
Even when it's breaking

Half a bottle of wine, the words fly that you can't take back
Those sweet red lips firing shots out baby
'Cause you want to make me mad
Throw me your keys, say you're gonna leave
Shatter me piece by piece
And girl you're trying to cut me deep
When you say we never meant anything

I'll keep my heart wide open
Take a bullet, take the blame
Anything for you, you

Ten below zero, sleeping on the street

Someday we all will have a home
A place to come in from the cold
Somewhere so high above the clouds
Why not here? Why not now?

Pastures of plenty for the tired and poor
Still too many hands empty behind the golden door

Someday we all will have a home
A place to come in from the cold
Somewhere so high above the clouds
Why not here? Why not now?

Someday we all will live the dream
There'll be no cracks to fall between
Somewhere where everyone will have enough
But here and now, it's up to us

Someday we all will be at peace
And all of our suffering will cease
There's more than enough to go around
So why not here? Why not now?
Why not here? Why not now?

Did you forget that time?
We were switching a ride in the car coming by
On a Saturday night

You said there's nothing to wait for
There's nothing to know
Were never waking up if we never let it go
I said I wanna believe but I'm out of control
And I've got so far to go, whoa

It's on the tip of my tongue as I drift through my body
Into the city within

It's coming out of the street light

There's nothing left to hide

You're gonna see it connect
You're gonna see em surrender oh

Or nothing's gonna change
And maybe we already know the way
Forever every day

Do you know why the spirit's calling
For my end to see?
It reminds us we're alive, this moment,
Of who we are, what we could be

There's nothing to pray for
There's nothing to know
We're never waking up if we never let it go
The fever is coming
It's shaking the ground
The city's alive so tonight we break out
It's coming apart now it's not too far
We'll never know why we arrive where we are
We'll never know why we bring the seed in these times
But if you wanna get high kid, just open your eyes

It's the reasons that keep me strong. They keep me hanging on and on and on. When the mood gets me so far, then you go.
Time to feel the softest blow. Waited for days for this night to get colder.
Time to feel the softest blow. Waited for days for this night, for this day to grow.

Through fireside parties, tears and cheers
And the hands of James Hooker flew over it's keys
And God know who else 'fore it came to me

And when I was alone I could be Julie Gold
It rang her ""From A Distance"" just like it was my own
I'd pretend I've the voice of Beth Neilsen Chapman
I wrote 'Late Night Grande' with just my right hand happenin'

Now it's keys rent the air in it's new place to stand
A gift for the children who'll play right and left hand

Oh, with the grace of that three-quarter grand
Oh, the grace of that three-quarter grand

Oh, it's lonesome in this corner at five am
I'd call Harlan Howard, only he'd understand
All those melodies that came to be
Mornings in this corner, that piano and me

And I wished for the left hand like Glenn D. Hardin
I could play Jimmy Webb or perhaps Randy Newman
Ah, it's a blessing, it never met Jerry Lee's feet
Just the hands of those children is all this Kimball needs

I'll let it go, let it go
That piano I bought from Al Jones long ago
I've let it go, I've let it go
And I smiled as it rolled out my door
And the songs that we wrote, ah, note for note
That piano will always know

Now it's keys rent the air in it's new place to stand

A sign to all the warriors who cannot hear
Amidst smoke of cannonballs, they bang the drums of death
Pound a cadence out for those who cannot see

Your words mean nothing to me

No I don't want to hear that you sorry
Your words are worthless to me

You can't keep all your apologies
Nothing to me

You can't keep all your apologies

The crashing sounds
Of fears I've never faced
Let them echo off these waves
With thoughts as brave as they once were
Heading for the moon
And, look
How we write
Over the white
Shadows may chase from behind
But just put them out of your mind, oh

The cloud capped towers, the gorgeous palaces
The solemn temples, the great globe itself

Yeah, all which it inherit shall dissolve
And like this insubstantial pageant faded
Leave not a rack behind

We are such stuff as dreams are made of
And our little life is rounded

A sunken giant sleeps off the coast of California
Go down the blue ravine where the way is steep and broken

She'll call me, I know she will look for me

They say that it doesn't look good for me

My CineColor baby, the lace sticks to your body
Battlefields of death fought for palaces of money
The song had my heart racing, the wine got my head heavy
My sword became so bloody, I don't know what I've done

Would you see me my love, would you wait for me?
Would you stand by the high prison gate for me?
Well they tell me it doesn't look great
And they say that it doesn't look great for me

Like a breath of fall on your weekend, I'm high
I said ""you know it's great to be worth it or to fall behind
Washed away
Washed away
Washed away""

Oh, the breath escapes me, I'm shaking like a lost thing
Invaded by your face, overtaken by a feeling

Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a slow torch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

[Chorus]
Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drownin' in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

Everything is cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

[Chorus]

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughin' at the rain
Little out of touch, little insane
Just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never comin' back
Runaway train tearin' up the track
Runaway train burnin' in my veins
Runaway but it always seems the same"

I can hear the guitars playin' lovely tunes

I close my eyes for a second and pretend it's me you want
Meanwhile I try to act so nonchalant
I feel a summer's night with a magic moon
Every time that you walk in the room
 
Baby it's a dream come true
Standin' right along side of you
Wish I could show you how much I care
But I only have the nerve to stare

I can feel a something pounding in my brain
Just any time that someone speaks your name
Trumpets sound I hear thunder boom
Every time that you walk in the room

Jaws gnashing at me
Each one trying to pull a piece away""

Some bad dreams even love can't erase

Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces

The leaves are electric
They burn on the river bank
Countless heatless flames&quot

We left that job to go
Back where people loved us once

323,danny schmidt,this too shall pass,Indie,en,"Things change fast
But this too shall pass
Better carve it on your forehead
Or tattoo it on your ass

'Cause who can tell
When the clock strikes twelve
If today's become tomorrow
Or if it's all just gone to hell

My friend makes rings
She swirls and sings
She's a mystic in the sense
That she's still mystified by things

But scared to ask
How can nothing last
'Cause like a cancer in your body
It all just goes too fast

We think too big
We think our self is one whole thing
And we claim that this collection
Has a name and is a being

But deep inside
When every cell divides
It sets upon the rule that states
Self-interest is divine

Cancer, too
Lives by this golden rule
That you must do unto the others
As the others unto you

All for the best
'Cause that's all the life accepts
And so we kill it like a buffalo
With awe and with respect

Don't ask God
Just ask the sky
She'll tell it to you plainly
In the clouds that whisper by

And praise the shapes
And then praise the way they change
And they'll teach you not to pray to light
Without you pray to rain

So I pray to hands
And I pray to needs
And I pray to blades of grass
To find forgiveness in the weeds

But as for health
I just never did believe
And so I never prayed myself
Except to those that prayed for me

The story goes
Or the way that I was told
There was a king that always felt too high
And then he fell too low

And so he called
All the wise men to the hall
And begged them for a gift
To end the rises and the falls

And here's the thing
They came back with a ring
It was simple and was plainly
Unbefitting of a king

Engraved in black
It had no front or back
But there were words around the band that said
Just know: This Too Shall Pass"

Face your fellow man,
Realize he's of evil breed.

For the child of the wild.

The beast in you and me?

Take a step into the wild,
Horrific creatures will hide.
You're the terror well disguised,
You're the fear that locks itself inside.

Embrace the untamed
See the grandeur under the grime.

By a wind from deep seas.

And you tremble by fright.

One kiss away from your sweet lips
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
'Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips
Your warm breath on my shoulder

Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you
It's too late to be free, can't you see?
I'm only one step ahead of your love
I try and yet I can't take two
Seems like I'll have to take that one step backwards

I'm really worried about living.
How could it come to this?
Yeah I really want to know about this.

It moved out 'cross the Mediterranean.
Came to western isles and the freak young men.
And with their silver beards they laughed
At the unknown universe.
They could sit and guess God's name.

But they said,

Yeah, we really want to know about this.

Blood just looks the same when you open the veins.
But sometimes it was faith, power or reason as the cornerstone.
But the furrowed brow has never left his face.

How could it come to this?
We've been living in a landslide!
How could it come to this?

Flew off from the planet.
He went to the moon,
Now he's out in space,
Hey, fixing all the problems.
He comes face to face with God.

Fell back into the rhythm of the ??
of livin and these skills I've been given
Never thought I'd make a living off this timin and precision
Got some rhymes hot enough to get a baker out the kitchen
Okay life is what you make it
And I'll take it if you give it

I surpassed all their limits

Triple bypass on a track, call a medic

Wonder why I am even second guessing

Flows so tip top

Barrel of a gun, kill yourself man, kick rocks
Right off a cliff, shit go head man get a walk

Steer clear from all these fuckers and these clones out here
So cheer cheer man these poems that I loan your ears
Are nothin more than my thoughts and my soul to bear

Bout advice dudes give me but none of it seems to sink in

I pay attention to some people I don't know
I got a small circle that I'm tryin to keep closed
Couple enemies that I'm tryin to keep close
They still irkin, but can't you see I'm workin?
Relentless persistence infectin the system
They can't get rid of me, I'm hittin like a kick drum
Aint tryin to socialize, workin on a thick buzz
Give me a coke on the rocks and some mixed rum
G-gawkin, starrin like a comet in the clouds
Every comet that's pronounced

To look across an empty sky
For a forgotten childhood reason
To once more wish that you could

Close your eyes and just believe again
There's a god does he remember when
We were young and faith was not pretend

Anymore
Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

And in the night he sees the ocean
Carve its thoughts upon the shore
For in the way it was created
It can do this and nothing more

And every message it would leave him
The next wave carefully erased
As the tears that passed between them

Were so real that you could

Close your eyes and just believe again
There's a god and he remembers when
We were young and faith was not pretend

Anymore
Anymore
Anymore

And all at once the waves were getting
Higher
And as they crashed I thought I heard them say
There'd be a time when men would all be wiser
When everyone, everyone,

Yes everyone is

Saved

And as he walked away he thought about

That third stowaway once more
And wondered if the body had washed up

Upon some far and distant shore

Or if it sank down through the depths
Of cold reality
To rest upon the ocean floor
For all eternity

For at the bottom of the sea
The dead do not feel pain
And neath the ocean made of tears

They never fear the rain

Was a stranger twist of fate

To be mad, to be yours alone!

And a barely can play

So I picked up my brush
Painted blue guitar
And I ripped off the chords
From 'Bron why' Aur'

So I played her a song
But the timing was wrong
Poor choices of chords

Of this one way ride
In the center lays the key
To get back off to a while
If you can't solve this riddle
I'm afraid you'll have to stay
In the ???
Of underestimated betrayal

See them point in your direction
See the indifference in their eyes
Just living in oblivion
Struggling with too many wires
So you've got to solve this riddle
Other wise you won't get back
So if I were you
I would concentrate on the morbid one way track"
385,billy bragg,no one knows nothing anymore,Folk,en,"Deep down in the underground, atoms spinning round and round
Scientists monitor readings
Searching for the Holy Grail, the particle or at least the tale
Of the one who gives the universe its meaning.

But what if there's nothing, no big answer to find?
What if we're just passing through time?

No one knows nothing anymore
Nobody really knows the score
Nobody knows anything
Let's break it down and start again

What happens when the markets drop,
If the numbers really don't add up?
Everyone seeks the safe haven.
And as they contemplate their ruin,
The self-proclaimed smartest people in the room
Are trying very hard not to sound craven

But what if there's nothing, no pot of gold to find?
Only the blind leading the blind.

No one knows nothing anymore
Nobody really knows the score
Seems nobody knows anything
Let's break it down and start again

Let's stop pretending
We can manage our way out of here.
Let's stop defending the indefensible.
Let's stop relying on
The lecturing of the experts
Whose spin just makes our plight incomprehensible.

High up on a mountain top, somebody with a skinned crop
Is thinking deep thoughts for us all.
Serenity is all around, but if you listen you can hear the sound
Of one head being banged against the wall.

But what if our ancestors had stayed up in the trees
Who'd be sleeping weighed down by these worries?

No one knows nothing anymore
Nobody really knows the score
Since nobody knows anything
Let's break it down and start again"

It calls to all that used to be
And it yearns for someone who was tender but untrue

Love is blind, it's helplessly inclined
To bind itself to discontent and fears, and fears
It [Incomprehensible] on nights that might have been
Love needs nothing more to do

My darling, so I hold each little talking
We knew, we knew
Endlessly I unfold each word we've spoken
We two, we two

Love is mad, it's beautiful but bad
It gladly weeps when disillusion appears, appears
And so I cling to yesterday while I'm hopelessly in love
While I'm hopelessly in love with you"

Why do they need more proof?

Has wakened you, and warned you, and called you to the test
Wake up from your sleep that builds like clouds upon your eyes

take a chance
spin the wheel
till i find something real
a love of my own

because the picture's so clear
the love high is so divine
there's nothing better
heaven is so far away
but she'll bring it right here
and i believe that she can see my

417,fates warning,quiteus,Metal,en,"From sleeping visions
Daily were torn
In waking hours
Hopes our forlorn.
Is all we do and all we dream
Doomed to drown in a hopeless stream?

Wishing life were made of lasting visions
In eternal sleep
And if that rest were filled with sorrow
Still we'd sleep.

In the madness of a silent eternity
We'd find solace in
False visions that protect us
From reality.

Enter ivory gates through midnight skies
Daylight dreamers in private parades
Perform before perpetual dawn
As dusk engulfs the gate of horn.

Ivory towers appear beyond the gate
Invisible fortresses of escape
Traversed by ramparts made of hopes and fears
Impervious to reality."

There was this old man started chattin' with me
He sat by himself on the side of the road
A cowboy hat and them pointed toes
He said, hey son what do ya do
Ya better pay attention when I'm talkin' to you
I've been around here for a long, long time
Could have bought this land for damn near a dime
(Right over there past that gas station over there, see it)
So I headed on over, leaned against his truck
And ya better hear me out or you're shit outta luck
I've been through times that you wouldn't believe
It makes a man feel about a hundred and three
Again he asked, what do ya do
I can't imagine by lookin' at you
Boy, things have changed since way back when
I wish that I was back in my teens again
I said hey, I said hey, to what the old man said
So we hopped in his truck, went for a ride
He talked about things before I was alive
Ya know, that used to be a big mining town
My brother and I brought that mountain down
My oh my, look how they built over there
Have ya ever thought about cutting that hair
Ya never told me what do ya do
Tell me kid, are ya just passing through
You say hey, you say hey, from what the old man said
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to speak my piece
So, low and behold when all was told the only listening one was me
So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to break on through
So, low and behold when all was told the stubburn one was he
So the moral of the story is ya gotta learn a lesson
Especially from a man who got a Smith and Wesson
Ya better learn with your ears and not with your eyes
Or you'll be dealt a big surprise

420,blessid union of souls,what have i got to lose,Rock,en,"I started to write you a letter the other day
Didn't know exactly what I was going to say
And at the last minute I threw it all away
'Cause I didn't think you'd read it anyway
And I'm the kind of man who's glass is half full
But I'm a bit torn from the strings you pulled
And since I already felt a bit abused
I thought to myself 
What have I got to lose?
'Cause I can't fall much further down
And look what I've got to win
If you would only hear my heart 

Yesterday I actually tried calling
But that was after six days and six nights of stalling
And I thought about everything that we've been through
All the different places that we went to
The times we hurt each other; sometimes we meant to
Trying to make up with flowers that I sent you
But now I'm at the crossroads, and it's time to choose
And I guess I just figured what the hell... 

What have I got to lose?
'Cause I've already come this far
And look what I've got to win
If you would only search my heart, and see what's deep inside 

Don't want to go to sleep, 'cause I don't want to dream
I always wake up with tears it seems
Can't blame it on you, so it must be me
I'll beg for forgiveness if that's what I need to do 

'Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
I've lost the one thing missing from my life
But look what I've got to win
If only I can get you to hear my heart
What have I got to lose?
When all I've lost is the everything that I need
And look what I've got to win
If you'll only listen, listen to my heart"

Dims his guiding light to just a spark
When the hour is low, he comes tumblin'
When the moon is high he gives his heart

Roll on, roll on, roll on, night birds are flyin'
Come on, the light is gone, hope's slowly dyin'
Tell me how you come ridin' through
Gainin' steady till this round is won
On the long and lonely road to kingdom come

People far below chasin' pleasures
Offer him directions on the run
Prophets on the path offer treasures
Though she's mighty hungry he takes none

Roll on, roll on, roll on, night birds are flyin'
Come on, the light is gone, hope's slowly dyin'
Tell me how you come ridin' through
Blindly faithful but followin' none
On the long and lonely road to kingdom come

When the sun goes down at the right time
She comes windin' through the purple haze
Just a feather's touch in the night time
But it'll color all my weary days

Shinin' finer than this earthly sun
On the ragged, rugged road to kingdom come
On the ragged, rugged road to kingdom come

They say he found down in seattle, won her at a young and tender age. Now she sings up here, while the men drink beer, Like a bird in a guilded cage. Well, one time a man from tulsa challenged pierre for her rose's hand, Now he lies below the the bitter snow in this wild and savage land. Some nights when the northern lights are shinin' And the cold north wind is howlin' across the snow. Is it just the wind that you hear sighin'...or could it be the sound of The yukon rose. Then one night a bigfoot just happened to be passin' by. And there in the dark his heart his lonely heart, Was touched by rose's lulaby. So he walked into the bar room and every one turned to stare, But he looked to them just like a bearded man, in a coat of grizzly Hair. Bigfoot saw the yukon rose and their eyes meet through the gloom. An' she was hypnotized by his gentle eyes, and was drawn across the Room. Now they say that love has no bounderies, an' I reckon that it's right, 'Cause beauty and the savage beast, fell in love that night. Some nights when the northern lights are shinin', An' the cold north winds are howlin' 'cross the snow, Is it just the wind that you hear sighin'... Or could it be the song of the yukon rose... Now pierre was in the back room, dealin' cards when the music stoped. He laid his hand down and looked around, and said nobody touch that pot. He walked out to the bar room and the trouble began, An' his blood ran cold when he saw the rose, in the arms of the tall Strange man. Pierre walked up and he grabbed her, an' shoved her t'wards the stage, And the gentle look in the strangers eyes, turned wild and red with Rage. An' then with just one mighty blow, pierre lay on the saw-dust floor. The tall strange man, took the ladies hand, an' walked out through the Door. No one dared to follow, and where he took her no one knows, But we all jumped back, when we saw the tracks. of bigfoot in the snow. Some say she probably died that winter, she must have I s'pose.

Up above the downtown market bricks
Right now a boy gets old
A boy gets bitter
A boy learns not to trust
Someone inside his room
The door locks tight
You keep the door locked

Months went by and doors got kicked in
Two outlaws collecting what they loaned
In a room beside my walls
A girl gets choked
She can't pay back the loan
48 more hours to go
""48 more hours"" that's all they say
In two more nights
I hear a sound
A shrill from one thin wall away

[Chorus]
Every place is the same
Every day is the same
Every place is the same
Violent
There's a conflicting sound
Hear the arguments loud
Everyday,

The sounds of the violent, violent, violent

I moved uptown a bit
Not much changed
The conflict's never gone
But just as a calm sets in
A police line barracades
A place next door I asked
Around the lot a store
Clerk told me two young
Kids were shot mother
Was near the tracks dragged
To where a train would go past

[Chorus: x2]

The sounds of the violent, violent
The sounds of the violent, violent"

Illusions an answer, but never the healer

Enchanted me

You were a father to my child
And a man to me
Now I'm no longer lost
Cause you showed me my way

I used to be so lost
In a world of untrue love
Then you came along and led me home
Well, at first I doubted you
And still you brought me through
And now I've found my way

You understand
All the pain that was caused by
Another man
You gave me love and not lust

Me and my child
We loved you so
But I want you to know
I'm awed by you

And the tender way you do
All the things you do

And living mirrors love.
And love just leaves me breathless.
On we go.

You love him all the way or not

When you've done everything to make it work
So when everything's not enough
Maybe he's just not the one

Sometimes love walks away
Sometimes love has to change
Sometimes the heart has to break
But you're not the only one
That's been hurt by love
Sometimes love's not the way
That you thought it would be
Sometimes you just got to leave
But you're not the only one
That's been hurt by love
When you love someone it's natural
To have second thoughts, should you go
It's not easy girl, being strong
You keep wondering if you were wrong
But don't you fall for that it's a game
The trying to make you feel you're to blame
To protect your heart there's no shame
You know better girl walk away

Be at peace, forever free
And you’ll live forever in our hearts

There will be another dawn
Just hold my hand, we’ll make it through this time
For everyone that’s gone
We must stand and all be strong
Together we can face this agony
Shall we live forever standing by?
Or can we give a moment of our time?
Stand with me, your soul is free
And you’ll live forever in our hearts
Be at peace, forever free
And you’ll live forever in our hearts
Now we’re calling out to keep the faith alive
And if we join as one you know hope will arrive
We can’t sit, we’ve got to rise and just reach out our hands

You stole my heart away from me
Made me believe true love could be

How could a love so strong not go right
Where do we go from here?
When it's said our love would stay around
Why do I even care
The way you looked it can't be found

Time to close the book to this story
I don't want to read it no more
Time to close the book to this story

Final chapter
I say goodbye, I made you cry
I did what I could, you know I tried
There's no more to say, so I'll go my way
You know that it hurts me
But that's the price we pay
Where do we go from here?

Good work is the key to good fortune
Winners take that praise
Losers seldom take that blame
If they don't take that game
And sometimes the winner takes nothing
We draw our own designs
But fortune has to make that frame 

We go out in the world and take our chances
Fate is just the weight of circumstances
That's the way that Lady Luck dances
Roll the bones 

Why are we here?
Because we're here
Roll the bones
Why does it happen?
Because it happens
Roll the bones 

Faith is cold as ice
Why are little ones born only to suffer
For the want of immunity 
Or a bowl of rice?
Well, who would hold a price
On the heads of the innocent children
If there's some immortal power
To control the dice? 

We come into the world and take our chances
Fate is just the weight of circumstances
That's the way that lady luck dances
Roll the bones 

Jack, relax
Get busy with the facts
No zodiacs or almanacs
No maniacs in polyester slacks
Just the facts
Gonna kick some Gluteus max
It's a parallax, you dig?
You move around
The small gets big, it's a rig
It's action, reaction
Random interaction
So who's afraid 
Of a little abstraction?
Can't get no satisfaction
From the facts?
You better run, homeboy
A fact's a fact
From Nome to Rome, boy

What's the deal, spin the wheel
If the dice are hot, take a shot
Play your cards, show us what you got
What you're holding
If the cards are cold
Don't go folding
Lady Luck is golden
She favors the bold, that's cold
Stop throwing stones
The night has a thousand saxophones
So get out there and rock
And roll the bones
Get busy"

Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place

Sometimes it feels as though I have a key
But every time I try it it won't turn for me
Seattle - you've got to love the rain
And we both love rain
We both love rain

We watched the city skyline from the ferry deck
And you put your arms around my neck
We talked of looking just out of town
Now it's looking like a dream shot down
I still believe that there's somewhere for us
But now it's something that we don't discuss
And you're the best thing I ever knew
Stay with me, baby, and we'll make it to

Only seven letters
Only seven hours to go

If there's still a place below

I file it away, handing in the tray
So I can only be who I am
Eleven fifteen, tapping the machine

Until the calender starts to jam

Echo echo echo down the wire

Nothing else to be

Oh walking about
We'll go back to the sea
And find what I'm about

I guess I probably loved you When those words rolled off your tongue It seemed that we were travelin' Under some ol' lucky sun I know I couldn't save you And no one was to blame But the road we shared together once Will never be the same Hey, hey gonna fly away Won't be coming round today Hey, hey with a song I pray And on the wings of a song I'll fly away. I wandered in the wilderness For a while I was so lost To everything there is a season And every blessing has it's cost So I took what you left me And put it to some use Went looking for an answer With those three cords and the truth I come down from the mountain I come walkin' in your shoes I was taken for a gambler When I had no more to lose 'Cause you put me on that pathway How could I refuse? And I spend my whole life out here Workin' on the blues So I carried on. You can't be haunted by the past. People come and people go. And nothing ever lasts. But I still think about you Wonder where you are Can you see me from some place Up there among the stars But down here under heaven There never was a chart To guide our way across This crooked highway of the heart And if it's only all about The journey in the end On that road I'm glad I came to know My old friend.

Took a taxi 
To the station 
Not a word was said 
I saw you walk across the road 
Maybe the last time, I don't know 

Feeling humble 
I heard a rumble 
On the railway track 
And when I hear the whistle blow 
I walk away and you don't know

Always her heavy hooves fall
On our stomachs, our hearts, or our heads
And Rome never heeds when we call

Her sentries pass on ""that is all""
And we gather behind them in hordes
And plot to reconquer their wall
With only our tongues for our swords

For we are the little folk, we!
Too little to love or to hate
Leave us alone and you'll see
How we can drag down the state

Mistletoe killing, an oak
Rats gnawing cables in two
Moths making holes in our coats
How they must love what they do

Yes and we little folk too
We are as busy as they
Working our works out of view
Watch and you'll see it someday

For we are the little folk we
Too little to love or to hate
Leave us alone and you'll see
How we can drag down the state

Yes it is true we are not strong
But we know of Peoples that are
Yes and we'll guide them along
To smash and destroy you in war

We should be slaves just the same
Yes we have always been slaves
But you, you will die of the shame
And then we shall dance on your graves

For we are the little folk we
Too little to love or to hate
Leave us alone and you'll see
How we can drag down the state

We are the worm in the wood
We are the rot at the roof
We are the taint in the blood
We are the thorn in the foot"

I get along very well
Now I know you’d much rather be

instead of someone like me
The big boys are back and we need them, you said
Think it was something you’d read
and it stuck in your head
Even though I don’t suppose
that’s as far as it goes
You’ve go quite an appetite
for being wronged and in the right
Well from now on it won’t affect me
I get along, get along
without you very well
I get along very well
The morning after the night before
I’d been alerted
to your lies
I phoned you up
Your calls were all diverted
Took a long time to track you down
even then you were defiant
It’s not what you think it is, you said
and proceeded to deny it
So I lost my patience at last
and it happened so fast
you belong in the past

Now when you climb [fade]
And when you lock [fade]
Just think of those
out in the cold and dark

I tell you, wake up
You people need a shake up
You take up so much time
Worrying, scurrying
Here, there
Losing your hair
No money to spare
No love to share
No wonder you appear under pressure from here
You look fresher
But all I got is dirt in my hair
My nightmares manifest
But I can escape
Your's is in your chest
With no form or shape
The tape is running
I push the button to send
Upon each other we all depend
Message end

Whoever asks my name
Or where I came from
People fear contamination
If they chary too long
I carry a strong
Scent of despair
It's in the air
I'm broken and hard to repair
I may mistaken be
But I patiently wait
On the path to humanity
I sit at the gates

Down the river
My liver in bad condition
Like my skin
Rain falling, once again
I'm in my bed
Hurt the time in
I'm gonna struggle for air
There's hair in my food
When I get it usually someone already half ate it
I try not to let it
Get me down
But my head's starting to pound
People go round, and round and round

From one I get a cigarette
A little more love found
But the ground is still wet
My teeth are chattering
And there's a spattering of seeds
Sometimes I lose all feeling in my feet
When I sleep I'll do my deep in the mainstream
But unaccountably my heart has grown
Small and mean
I hurry past
Retched people I pretend I haven't seen
But there's money in my pocket
And my clothes are clean

But I just can't give no love
Money in my pocket

Way down inside me long ago
And now I can't remember when it was

It's such a little song it don't compare
With all your big ones you hear everywhere
But when it dawns way in the back of your mind
The big ones are made up of the little kind

Union song, union battled
All added up won us all what we got now
Union song, union battled
All added up won us all what we got now

I can't even start to look around me here
Without hearing this song
And seeing all of us first separated
Hurt apart and afraid

Hungry for the union
And so we kept on
Singing and working, fighting till we got it
And this is the big union song I guess I hear

Union song, union battled
All added up won us all what we got now
Union song, union battled
All added up won us all what we got now

We fought there at your place
We fought there on your ship
And I guess if you missed out on
The fight for our union

You missed out on one awful big step
Us people took

570,steve lawrence,begin the beguine,Jazz,en,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine"
571,tilly and the wall,rainbows in the dark,Indie,en,"One, two, three, four!
I was kidnapped real young by the sweet taste of love
Built a fondness for things that just weren't good enough
I cradled the crow, always shooed off the dove
Which tagged me a naive son
So the fortunate kids, yeah they left on their lights
And they stuck up their noses and started some fights
Their parents all cackled at dirt on my hands
While my father was slaving, my mother explained it
Sometimes that's just how it is
So my sister went kissing a maple-skinned boy
Finally held up her fists, said ""I'm done being coy!""
And the neighborhood boys started buzzing with joy
We finally had front page news
Although it was sad, I couldn't help but laugh
Such ridiculous hate in the hot summer sweat
I laid on my back, let the punk record spin
The stomping guitar, it was shooting out stars
It all went to my heart, yeah some rainbows in the dark
So I called up danger, my friends and some strangers
They stumbled and wavered, one called me his savior
They slipped me the blood in the whole of the vial
But I didn't feel them change
Then I met a man with a fist for a hand
Held me flat on my back, taught me how to give in
Some phrases were shot, pretty roses got tossed
The gift of a fat-lipped grin
Now they're drilling my teeth while I'm soiling sheets
With my lover, she's counting the diamonds on rings
And even when truth doesn't help with the sting
Out of no numbers, some harsh looking color
You pull them out, feel they're changed
No need for a thousand cranes
So I thank the city, the lights that it's spinning
The friends that I have and the shoes we're not shining
The drunk horn's so violent, all spinning out sounds
But the color's so vibrant , the color's so loud
The newly-born crying realizing what life is
In the eyes of my grandpa, the right people dying
The see-saw of love, its rickety bounce
The feeling of coming, the feeling of going
The mother, the child, the tame and the wild
The sleeping in minor, the gold leaf, the tire
The crooked, the straight, all the hip and the fake
Oh, I'm finally feeling the stitching of beautiful seams
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Sometimes you just can't hold back the river
Hold back the river, hold back the river, hold back the river"

But it don't know if it's coming or going,

There is fashion, there is fad
Some is good, some is bad

Why don't we recognize the faces loving us so
What's God if not the spark that started life
Smile of a stranger
Sweet music, starry skies
Wonder, mystery, wherever my road goes
Early wake-ups in a moving home
Scent of fresh-mown grass in the morning sun
Open theme park gates waiting for
Riding the day, every day into sunset
Finding the way back home
Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead
This moment the dawn of humanity
The last ride of the day
Wake up, Dead Boy
Enter adventureland
Tricksters, magicians will show you all that's real
Careless jugglers, snakecharmers by your trail
Magic of a moment

You make it to your job and hear Atlanta lost another
How can you lose while making half a million bucks or near

Says the Russians are a coming but they've been here for years
Trying everything from Jesus to Jack Daniels it's the all new American diet
Trying everything from Jesus to Jack Daniels
You get on it and you're on it for the rest of your life

There's a story in the paper about a man who killed his family
He jumped off a bridge because he couldn't take it anymore
Down at the local tavern a young man comes in limpin'
And he claims that he's a veteran of the Falkland Islands war
You head home and you're accosted by a youngster wearin' robes
And wanting money for his God who sits upon a plastic throne
You ignore him if you can and make it to the local tavern
Where you order up a drink and give some money to your own
Trying everything from Jesus...
There's a man in Tennessee who's got it figured out completely
I guess that he's as happy as a thinking man can be
I asked him what he thought and he said brother let me tell you
Try a little bit of both and leave out everything in between
Trying everything from Jesus..."

Until lightning struck the sky

This house looks so creepy
Anybody home?
Look out! There's somebody!
We're not alone

Up three creaking wooden stairs
An old man with no hair, stares!
Sitting in a rocking chair

""Please be my guest""

He says I'm glad you are here
I have been waiting for years
You see, they land in my field

""Tonight's the night""

Hey!
You'll see, don't you worry
Make yourself at home
Maybe they'll be friendly
Or maybe not, but
Hey!
What if we're all crazy?
What if we're alone?
Then the sky is empty
And we're alone
We are alone
We're not alone
Are we alone? Alone

Looking deep into the night
We'll see if the old man's right
So far, there's nothing in sight

""Except frostbite""

Flying low without a sound
Look out! They are all around
Spinning down, touching the ground

""Damn he was right!""

Hey!
We see! We're not worried!
We're not going home

Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be

And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be

Till the past became clear and the future went blank
In the path she regains all her beauty and pride
But that was before Jessie died

Jessie, her husband was small, he was lean
Drove a big yellow earth moving machine
They had a new pick-up, the joy of their lives
But that was before Jessie died

She used to go shopping for pretty young clothes
And her hair done Thursdays and her nails and her toes
And on weekends they danced till the first morning light
But that was before Jessie died

On weekends they'd cook out and watch all the games
Jessie knew all of the best players names
The sunshine so bright it put tears in your eyes
But that was before Jessie died

When Jessie got sick he was thirty years old
They said, ""It ain't nothing but a little light cold""
And he worked till the pain wouldn't ease or subside
And that was before Jessie died

Now she sits on the stool with a glass in her hand
She smiles and she talks to a travelin' man
And there was time she would turn down a ride
But that was before Jessie died

She sat on the bar stool, she smoked and she drank
'Till the past became clear and the future went blank
In the path she regains all her beauty and pride

We're floating in the moonlit sky
The people far below are sleeping as we fly
I'm holding very tight
I'm riding in the midnight blue
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you
Far across the world
The villages go by like trees
The rivers and the hills
The forests and the streams
Children gaze open mouth
Taken by surprise
Nobody down below believes their eyes
We're surffing in the air
We're swimming in the frozen sky
We're drifting over icy
Mountain floating by
Suddenly swooping low on an ocean deep
Arousing of a mighty monster from its sleep
We're walking in the air
We're floating in the midnight sky
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly
I'm holding very tight
I'm riding in the midnight blue
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you"

It,
And it's all she's got.
She made that apple pie from a memory,
Made them biscuits from a recollection that she had.
She cooked that chicken too long but she don't know that,
Oh what the hell, it ain't too bad.

Don't talk about the war, I was a coward,
Talk about fishing and all the good times raisin' hell.

618,fred small,the last time i had autumn,Folk,en,"Northfield Minnesota frost upon the plow
The barley and the soybeans are at the feed lot now
Leaves as dry as paper crumble neath my tread
Colors of October like memories of the dead

And the last time I saw autumn's fire was a thousand years ago
I put my faith in autumn -- seasons come seasons go
And every sign of autumn now is bound to make me blue
The last time I had autumn I had you
The last time I had autumn I had you

The crooked streets of Cambridge are skirted now with snow
There's a bookstore crammed with browsers every twenty yards or so
And one night last December I searched each one high and low
To find the gift you wanted that only I would know

And the last time I felt winter's blast was a thousand years ago
I put my faith in winter -- seasons come seasons go
And every gust of winter now is bound to make me blue
The last time I had winter I had you

How many times must I pull the car to the shoulder
Just to cry by the side of the road
How many times must I reach and grasp at nothing
Before I can let you go

In the hills above Las Cruces forget-me-nots have bloomed
I walk the ridge till sundown and whistle a lover's tune
They've put me in the same old bed and the people here are kind
I get the urge to call you and put it from my mind

For the last time I breathed springtime air was a thousand years ago
I put my faith in springtime -- seasons come seasons go
And every breath of spring now is bound to make me blue
The last time I had springtime I had you
The last time I had springtime I had you

To rock the night away

To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

I got the type of skills that make you want to quit
I might be ill and my mic it steals that old beyonder shit
I harm the shit, but see next this keen text
be-ing ex-pelled from my diaphragm

I bust like cleavage, rock shit, then I leave it
in shambles, 'cause I can like Campbell's
A sample of Tajai, is much more than average

I got me and three brothers that are cocky
to rock the, masses, whippin niggaz asses
At last it's, appropriate to show that I can blast kids
I'm quick to stick a dick in skin
I'm figuring I hinder men, so let's sin, and watch this nigga win
I'm making corpses, of course I score kids
I'm morbid, cause it makes me think of more shit to kick

When my sound swings, I found things
to bequeath, you're beneath, you need relief, to be brief
I crushed ya, flushed ya, from the cypher
'cause I sliced your life to pieces
In ruins, I screw in, skills like drills
So who and, what army can harm me?
Kill, the noise, my boys, never lack poise
But you wack toys get played as I slay

My stick drives you crazy flip it backwards and it plays the
satanic messages I guess it is my nature
To break your mental barriers to take your body over
Drove ya, off a cliff I got the gift to shapeshift

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is."

Justice for a mind in chaos

Heavy is heaven
The devil on my two tons too

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement
Passed the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
And out through china
Nearly misses air liners
Magnified times five
This is pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest a blaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all of that
Most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow
Meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called
And they told him to wait
Un-strap him from the chair
And put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gone clap and they ain't gone praise
They want everything back that they paid
Cause they been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim


If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh

So chauffeur chauffeur come and take me away
Cause I been standing in this line
For like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown
M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every songs a favorite song
And mikes don't feed back
All the reviewers say you need to go and see that
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
Then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the camera's here and the microphone and they wanna know
Oh oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are
A super star
Then have no fear the crowd is here and the lights are on and they want a show
Oh oh oh oh"

i could be so much that would be a miracle

miracles they happen everyday
in ordinary ways life is a miracle of ordinary love
its true and simple as it seems
ordinary love is a miracle to me
we're looking for stars that shoot across the sky
bring fairy tales to life
that would be a miracle
so often we miss the little things in life
while we pray for a miracle and hope for the miracle but still we find that

that it all depends on you and then the ordinary becomes extraordinary

That I was sailing on the seas and I was out to explore
And it was lucid in a way homey I didn’t need oars uh-uh
I had a feeling that I’d been there before yo
I hit shore it was shrouded in mist
And in the distance coming in view a primordial forest
A people then approached waving their hands
They were speaking in a tongue I could not understand
They led me though at last to a beautiful fire
And it deepened in a way that I forgot I admired
What emerged was more than the wholeness within
I’d seen the men who had been me the beasts I had been

Anxiety was filling me and was this all a mistake
An elder fell to the ground marking the dirt
He was drawing up a map defining sky and the earth
He pointed to the east, north, west, and the south
And then he pointed to the heavens and he started to shout
The women in the front at once began to chant
While the men beat on drums and that elder man danced

Strong independent women, come on
Yea, huh

What you think gangstas don't cry get hurt by lies
Times you embarrassed me I swallowed my pride
I'm tired of telling you I got nothing to hide
I'm in the studio at night you think I'm out with the guys
Every time I speak to you you got something to say
According to you I'ma speed crushing all day
All I'm askin you for is to be more trusting
I'm outta town all the time and don't accuse you of nothing
Picture me creepin with a chick on tour
When you love my son as if it was yours
I know at times you feel alone cuz I'm not at home
That's why every few hours I pick up the phone
To reassure you my love is more then a scene
I adore you my wife my Colombian queen
I promise to never stray I'm on it everyday
To have a woman like you in the life of Jose (Hey)

Yea how I'm supposed to start this
First and first you my queen goddess
My moon my earth the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge
I swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college
And still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and
Touring making dollars assuming that I love you or regardless
I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's
Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)
Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl)
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all holes gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title
You my future my happiness my heart my idol
I promise girl, that

This is going out to you, you and you and you

To all the ladies out there if you love your man
You need to hold your man embrace your man
And just grab his hand repeat after me
I promise to stay true and give you all of me
Whether he's locked down or on the grind
Or whether is out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man and respect that man
And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and

Through the good times and bad times who will always...

Meant to be together, meant for no one but each other

Nigga crossed me, I cut him off
And I felt crazy, 'cause I got a purple heart
Shit I'd rather work and walk
'Fore I ride luxury with niggas that don't fuck with me
I'm starting to hate this fame shit, look what it done done to me
Seen half these niggas turn they back on rappers, tryna come for me
Don't want 'em in my company, jsut wanna be accompanied
Hundred mil', Dreamchaser chasin' dreams, hate is fake and love is real
Niggas said I wouldn't win, told them yes, the fuck I will
Hit the studio with all my feelings and I let 'em spill
Forever thorough, be a sucka nigga? No I never will, know!

I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always start
Damn, the game left with me a heavy heart (heavy heart)
The streets left with me a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas say they with you when they really not (really not)
Niggas plot on everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left with me a heavy heart (heavy heart)

Uh, my heart heavy, my soul cleaner
When shorty got a big head, I was like ""Hold, Gina!""
I made a mil, I got a deal, I lit the whole team up
I had the whole squad lit, I had the city poppin'
I told my dawg don't listen to 'em, get caught up in that gossip
They wanna see you in the hood, back when you ain't got shit
Remember nights was on the 'gram, toasting with the pilot
Then everything was sour, this little thing of ours

I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always start

Will walk that road together
Through fire an' water, ice an' snow,
Heaven above us, an' hell below,
Holding on, trying to walk the line
With sweet temptation running close behind
I'm talking 'bout love
Ooh, love
Like a fire forever burning,
A flaming heart that's yearning, more an' more
A love to keep us warm
On the wings of the storm
Everyday an' every night
I keep hoping it'll be all right,
Trying to leave the past behind,
Still looking for some peace of mind
But, destiny brought us together
An' promised us a time that would last forever
Tho' it's all been said before
It's the kind of love worth fighting for
I'm talking about love
Ooh, love

New overtones in view
Endless form, endless time
If what they say is true
You are a shadow in the fourth dimension
To float away with you
We see the corners where nothing happens
While we drifted we were one
Ceilings lifted walls were gone
You speak the language of the breeze
All your leaves were meant for me
The love that every person wants to be
Stuck together, I don't like revealing secrets
I'll live inside your lips if you won't laugh
My heaving hands on rotten fruit at last
Fallow fingers, there's a surface I can count on
She'd fit inside my heart and take it over
Till her cape got blown into my red lungs

Or I'm heading out at breakfast
Take a drink, take a drag
One more coffee, ugly hat
No more mirrors, woolen bag

Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin' more than to rhyme
Almost like he was born in the rhyme
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time
And he fought with his mom
His school getting caught with his rhyme book
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place
At least he shouldn't of been sittin lookin there in her face with it
Teacher told him get it out of her class
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why you won't pass
Now if you shy you won't last but you're new
So underneath his breath before he left he said I'm a be richer then you
What you say? She said.
What you mean? He said.
Boy don't you play, she said.
What you mean? He said
Damnit.
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son.
You testing me? You messin up again
You done boy.

A real scary story
Went from rags to riches it has goblins in it haters and witches
Uh.

First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money.
He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey.
The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny.
But they gave him the money so they played the record company.
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal
But for real it wasn't like that then.
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was
havin Started antagonizing the guy's he was with
At the same time he started realizing
The deal he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits
He called a meeting to find a solution.
He said I'm gettin beat out of my loot
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution
The dude's said we found a solution its this .44
He ran for the door a little shaken
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you
Just do me a favor

Great scotts, it's hot today
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air
His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn't care
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck
Shooting like a muthafuckin vietnam vet
Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots
On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop
You better have a spot up in town my nigga
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat
Grease strikes you out with no get back
Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me
We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em
LBC in this muthafucka cuz
I had to show these niggas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a bitch to mack your grip
Or better yet, strapped a clip
To a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater
And put the ride down out of G two seater
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this skandelous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game nigga
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cut throat on the downlow
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight."

No star to far apart
Your carpet ride holding me
You led me to believe that I was yours, yours
I swallowed every lie
And you will cry when I'm away ,on your own , like me
when I was yours

I could live my life without you, that is not enough
I can't lie awake believin' you don't want my love
Alone in my desire
And still the fire burns , my friend
I was there 
I loved you well
Though we are far apart , I love you still
I relive the very moment when you called me yours , yours
Don't let me die inside
Save me from the memories, the hours that I cried
Say to me that I am yours, yours , mine eternity
And you will cry when I'm away
On your own , like me ,when I was yours

Stand in awe of the wisdom of God
Hear what He has to say

Deep inside of me
It was gentle and mild like the voice of a child
My mind's eye could see
It spoke of the promises
Made to my people through Abraham
And at once all the prophesy made sense to me
I'd studied them so long
Why couldn't I see
In one holy moment I knew the Messiah was He

Will my heart make me believe it so,
Or can I trust the way I feel,
If you could read my mind,
You see how hard I've tried,
Still I can't decide,
Chorus:
If you only knew,
What I've been going through,
Waiting and wanting you,
Could this be love,
Oh, tell me could this be love,
Do you know if it's true,
That real love lasts a life time,
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky,
And do you know if you can fall for,
Just a moment,
Is a moment for all time,
Why, why am I so unsure,
Is that love knocking at my door,
Or the sound of my beating heart,
If you could read my mind,
You know I just can't hide,
What I feel inside,
(CHORUS)
Could this be love,
Could this be love,
I wanna know,
If you only knew."

Palm trees grow and rents are low

Making my way back

Well I'm New York City born and raised
But nowadays
I'm lost between two shores
L.A.'s fine, but it ain't home
New York's home
But it ain't mine no more

""I am""... I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
Not even the chair

And I am lost and I can't
Even say why
Leavin' me lonely still

Did you ever read about a frog
Who dreamed of bein' a king
And then became one
Well except for the names
And a few other changes
If you talk about me
The story is the same one

But I got an emptiness deep inside
And I've tried
But it won't let me go
And I'm not a man who likes to swear
But I never cared
For the sound of being alone

""I am""... I said
To no one there

Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

When you face the world alone

If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt

Copped work from Saint Nick,

It's no good praying to the powers that be
'Cause they won't shake the roots of the money tree
No good praying to the pristine alters
Waiting for the blessing with Holy water
They like the same old wealth in the same old hands
Means the same old people stay old people stay in command
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
They got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

Too much money in too few places
Only puts a smile on particular faces
Said too much power in not enough hands
Makes me think ""get rich quick; take all I can""
They're too busy spending on the means of destruction
To ever spend a penny on some real construction

Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
They amuse themselves as they fool around
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like they say, make them vulnerable

No good looking to the Empire corners,
""Civilization"" built on slaughter
Carrying hopes and carrying maps
The spinless ones fall in their laps
The brave and the bold are the ones to be fooled
With a diet of lies by the Kipling school

Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
But I just can't help being cynical
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like I say, make me wonderful

Their morals are clean and their clear
They bend your arm and they bend your ear
Said they bend your mind as you talk in circles
Bend over forwards, this won't hurt you
Till there's blood in your lap; blood on your hands
Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
Come spend a penny, go out with a pound
Watch the money-go-round; watch the money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

(On the money-go-round, you wanna get on but it won't slow down)

The need your votes and you know where to send 'em
Be we don't get the choice of a public referendum
On all the real issues that affect our lives
Like the USA base to which we play midwife
Take a cruise and forget this scene
Said come back later when the slates wiped clean

Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Born of woman, killed by man
Watch the money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
Do like they pray, make it wonderful

The good and righteous sing their hymns
The crimpoline dresses who have no sins
Christians by day, killers in war
The hypocrites who know what they're fighting for
Killing for peace, freedom and truth
But they're too old to go so they send the youth

Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
I don't think he was an astronaut
Watch the money-go-round, watch the money-go-round
I must insist - he was a Socialist!

Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
They got it wrapped up tight, they got it safe and sound
Watch your money-go-round; watch your money-go-round
As you fall from grace and hit the ground

Ela já nasceu estrela, mas o mundo ainda não sabia
Na cabeça mil ideias e a carteira bem vazia
Dormiu com o namorado e com ele se sentia viva
Mas o que ela tanto queria era acordar como uma diva
O que ela vai fazer, se o seu sonho tá dividido
Andar de limousine ou torná-lo seu marido?
Agora nasceu a confusão porque ela não pode ter tudo
Filhos, jardim, família e ser famosa pelo mundo
Ela quer andar pelas ruas e ser reconhecida
Ter um bilhão de fãs e na internet ser seguida
E ela não quer briga, só quer o que é seu
Mas ele ficou com medo da grande estrela que percebeu

Yeah I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had sh-t
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months since I've single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho Ho
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did

Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a double milli in the air just for the heck of it

completely separate
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me would know what
hungry was, Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing
Eu quero ser muito famosa
E usar apenas Loboutins
Ter no twitter um milhão de fãs
Eu quero um carrão blindado
E você do lado
Quero o selinho da Hebe Camargo
Sempre que eu vou me deitar
Eu vejo o meu nome brilhar, oh não, não
Mas sinto que se estou com você eu tenho paz

Though summer turns to winter..."
748,the doobie brothers,travelin' man,Rock,en,"The sun brings up another day
Near the little fishin' town
The nets are hung out in the wind
The sails are down
A seagull flies above my head
Spinning slowly towards the sea
He seems so free, and just like me
He rides the wind

[Chorus]
I'm a travelin' man
Nothin' left behind me but the road
I'm a travelin' man
Won't you share the load

Lonesome shepherd in the field ahead
Moonlight flows across the grass
The rocky hills catch the light above
Their shadows cast
Lonely by the day
Drifting late at night
The wind is creepin' through my ragged coat
What a life

The sky so blue, the grass so green
The rank and file and the navy blue
The deep and strong, the straight and true
The blue line they got the given sign
The belts and boots march forward in time
The wood and leather the club and shield
Swept like a wave across the battlefield
Now with all the clarity of dream
The blood so red, the grass so green
The gleam of spur on chestnut flank
The cavalry did burst upon the ranks
Oh the iron will and iron hand
In England's green and pleasant land
No music for the shameful scene
That night they said it had even shocked the queen
Well alas we've seen it all before
Knights in armour, days of yore
The same old fears and the same old crimes
We haven't changed since ancient times."

Someone else is sharing your bed
Maybe you picked up where I left
Now my heart is sinking
I don't know what I've been thinking
I turned a strong man weak
I threw him down, brought him to his knees
I'm hoping somehow he'll forgive me

Swinging back and forth
Just leave him alone-o-one

You'll never be sure

I should probably level with you
Meant it when I said, ""I do""
Don't know why I was untrue
With everything I put you through
How'd it make you feel
If I said I still love you
If I could go back
Select all, press undo
Never thought we'd be this couple
I ran at the first sign of trouble
I turned a strong man weak
I threw him down, brought him to his knees

I came to say goodbye, say goodbye

Just passin through to let you know that I remember the times we shared
Your mother prayed for us both night and day
I guess this is what she feared
The picture in my room keeps your image sharply in my head
All in my head
I just can't let go of the memories I had; will this madness ever end?
[Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder if it's better to be free or be in jail
Incarceration at this time to me is better than heaven or hell
I often wonder if you'd still be here if you had won your bet
Won your bet
You most likely soon see me we'll all be a memory
if we don't change this mess..
change it or we gone y'all

Hi, passing you through to let you know
Passing you through to let you know
That I, gonna tell everyone I know
Gonna tell everyone I know

This is our world, our future
These are our times
I believe we have to see
In silence there's no mystery
The world is so busy talking
What do they know
They're missing out on being alive
Words are turning into lies
We're looking for love to guide us
What do we know
The truth is never to be told
It's waiting there inside your soul
The innocent join
In fighting so easily
In a world of pain and war
Who knows what they're fighting for
What they're fighting for
Oh, what they're fighting for
What they're fighting for
Many rivers running out to sea
One heart with a cry for love
Many dreamers in a moonlit sky
One sigh and they are gone
Love is the only direction
That leads to truth
Knowing in your heart what's right
You'll walk upon the sea of light
There's something
In love and silence
That you can find
Know yourself and all around
Listen to the only sound

Loneliness  my way to say 
I needed you  and all you do 
To come and rescue me 

The day I saw your face 
Everything fell into place 
The melody of you and me 
The love song that we shared 
And they say 

Love isn't love 
Until you've got someone to share it with 
And I've got you 
And it's made me realize that 
Love  oh love 
Love is something we take advantage of 
Through you I've learned that love is on my side 

But the feeling still flows deep inside 
Takes my breath away 
When it tries to stay 
I only love you more 
Oh, don't try to tell me I'm a fool 
I know this is something new 
Just guide me through 
I'm here to do 
Whatever you want me to 
And they say 

Love isn't love 
Until you've got someone to share it with 
And I've got you 
And it's made me realize that 
Love, oh love 
Love is something we take advantage of 
Through you I've learned that love is on my side 

On my side 
Love is on my side 

I sit here and wonder why 
I can't get you off my mind 
A special scent 
And all you meant 
To me 

It's a love that just won't go away 
I hear it in the things you say 
I can't ignore (I can't ignore) 
I want you more and more, more and more and more

Niggas ain't on it like I'm on it, I own shit
I got my own bentley, I got my own rolls
I'm a pimp, bitch, I own hoes
I got my own diamonds around my own cubans
I own rolexes and frank muellers
I do what the fuck I want to
I'm grown, I own lots of shit, proper shit
I bought a couple before the dealership got the shit
Rich nigga, six figures
I double up every flip, my stash bigger
Plane hoppin', globetrottin'
A nigga blow a little paper when it's time to move
Fuck old money for the new money
No tellin' what a real nigga gon' do
I do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own money
I just do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own house
I do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown
I got my own car
I just do what the fuck I want to, I'm grown, I'm grown
I'm on straight remy, no chaser
Wanna smoke, but I'm still on paper
I mix purp' and yellow like a laker
Headed to the moon and I just might take ya
Split my blunt with a little bitty razor
While this thick bitch just twerk on the table
I talk big nips, look like fantasia
She ready, willin' and able
Just got a piercing in her navel
Walking nine to five and she staying
She say she flying down to my city
Cause she got a birthday coming in april
We ain't got no kind of commitment
Why you worried 'bout if I'm hitting it?
Don't worry about how I'm getting it
Stay the fuck up out of my business
No more stressin', I'm vvs'in', ballin' lessons on dvd
Pay per view shit, making moves since 2'03, can't see me free
That love gon' get you like ddp, psa: I'mma be okay, I'm the iron g
Fix flash and I'm a fly emcee, I put a duffle on all of y'all
Trouble can't ignore me, I was born to ball
Fuck is up? I'm one of one, I need a custom cut
Hear the summer come, I want the number one
Bitch, walk in with a fleet behind me
Shades damn near to the sneaks, gianni
Too nights and no repeating, mami
I'm guttered up, my streets define me
I drop your ass to the floor, it'll be more
Rob me I'll make a detour, robbery how I get to her
Probably want out like I knew her, I done got colder
Chip on my shoulder, head when I sit in the rover
Brought me a zipper to odor, phone numbers slid in the folder
Bullshitting how? Show you my pimping diploma
Brought an audemar for when times was hard
Nine calls from the 9th ward
Mardi gras, take your top off
I'm a nasty nigga, might slide and roll
Fly your girl out to miami
Sent her back home like they done lebron
I ain't tripping if you ain't tripping
Party hard 'till he calls the law
Got my own house so I can throw you out
I got my own blunt so I ain't putting it out
This is my car and I can smoke it out
Got my own money and like four accounts
Bought my own bottles so I can pour it out
Got my own shooters and they scoping out
Bought my bitch an ass, now it's poking out
If she don't throw it back then I'mma throw her out
My condo money don't fold out, wild all out
Hoes out, let's roll out, funeral when I go south
Girl, your mouth got the kind of brain I don't know about
I never changed, I'm so south, big chains and a gold mouth
I'm rollin out"

I'm having troubles with control

I find it hard to be myself

I do not think it's my health

You're the one I wish I had
And now my girlfriend is getting mad

Today as I was walking down
You bumped into me
You said, ""excuse me"" and walked away
As I dropped to my knees
I prayed to the being in the sky
That my parents told me of
I asked about you but no reply
No clues about your love
My girlfriend left me on the phone
I'm pathetically left here alone

To all the realest ones and rich thugs

Fuck a million dollars, boy, I need a billi' for sure

Those brothers is dead
I don't even like what they said
What are they talking about man
Tell em again
Listen homegirls let me talk to you
Girls may be trouble but girls are trouble too
Next time a guy try to give you a play just turn your head and dis him and walk away
Excuse me ice cream tee
Hello how do you do
Quite fine my darling and how are you
Well I'm doing quite fine but I'm kind of upset
Because I heard a little something I could not forget
What's that?
I heard you say that girls are nothing but trouble
And now I'm taking this time to bust your bubble
Your arrogant conceited your stuck on yourself
And bragging nearly every time you open your mouth
You think you'll gets the women success will turn your head
Well I'm sorry to inform you that stuff is dead
Wait a minute let me talk to you
I think I should inform you who you're talking too
No let me tell you so you remember me
As the one that bust your bubble I'm ice cream tee
I'm Jazzy Jeff and I'm the Fresh prince
Before we have you arrested what's the meaning of this
You say girls are full of trouble I must play this to you
Girls may be trouble but guys are trouble too
You're a compulsive liar you mind is full of dirt
All you do is worry about what's up a girls skirt
You cant hurt these people because you got a big mouth
You go run and tell your boys how you made out
I think ruthfully your sick you need to be kicked
See I'm getting my loaded weapon you get on my nerve I go click
Guys think they own their girlfriends females aren't possession's we are humans
We like to be wined and dined by candle light
Not being couped up in the house trying to be held up tight
So jazzy jeff and fresh prince don't mean to bust your bubble
But guys of the world ain't nuthin but trouble
So homegirls next time a guy tries to give you the play
Just turn your head and cold diss him and walk away
This amazing hot day I went to see Barney from work
My briefcase in my hand sitting down on my skirt
The undergounds of the surface was the scene of my walk
I got approached from the rear e said baby can we talk
I looked him in the eyes with this fabulous smile
He said I just got paid lets hang out for a while
I said first would be my pleasure to know who you are
And do I have to use my tokens or do you have a car
Well my name is the prince and I'm a great rap star
You don't have to use your tokens I've got a jaguar
I knew there was no doubt I'd jump on this mission
I proceeded to tell him my name with police suspicion
I said ice cream tee was the title I was given
SWP the name of the hood I live in
So we jumped in the ride hit the 95 we turned into his block pulled up in his drive
First step in the house I saw a mouse
I said 90 in the wrong trips and then with the ow
He came running to my rescue he was a little late
My hair was broke my briefcase was in a totally different place
He said I'm sorry take a sip of this bacardi
And excuse me while I go freshen up for the party
I got a little confused I said party what's up with dude
He didn't even tell me I thought that was quite rude
Suddenly through the door was three men in suits
They said hey sweet mama who are you
I said im ice cream tee and who may you be
I'm brother charles brother rick and he's brother ali
Are you here to see the prince
Prince no prince works for me im running the show
Work for me and at 12 o clock midnight you'll be working 42nd street
O my god I was totally stunned he yanked me up slapped my cheek and put his ands on my buns
I said ha you better watch it sucker
I said to myself I got to go get my geurney
E put me in this locker called me a b e and h
Looked around noticed that there was no escape
Left the room went behind closed doors
I pulled down got my briefcase that was on the floor
Flipped the latch lift the lid Pulled out my smith n wesson
Yes my shiny black loaded a 357
Stepped out of the room dressed in shoot of the load
And said they all lay me down and hit me with this tune
When they see my smith n wesson their eyes got bigger
I relaxed latch off chilled back and pulled the trigger
Picked up the briefcase broke out on the double
These guys of the world are full of trouble
Cant live with em cant live without em."

Old photgraphs always make me laugh
Ponytails and golden locks
Dirty old boys from down the block
Always knew someday we'd have to go
Our separate ways
And you'll find someone to be
And I'd just go on being me

Chorus
Always searching, always finding
We love too easily
We end up some man's family
Always believing the unbelievable
Forever leaving for another man's love

Old photographs always make me laugh
Racin' on our bicycles, sun meltin' popsicles
Jumpin' on trampolines,children have the neatest things
And July Fourth was never hot
The sun was just a great clock

Repeat Chorus

Old photographs always make me laugh
What happened to the dreams
What we thought were the simple things
It's been a long time now
And still it's funny how
Old photographs sometimes make me cry
Old photographs sometimes make me cry

My secret thoughts known only by the few
It was a dream much to real
To be leaned against too long
All the time I think she knew

Her words still dance inside my head
Her comb still lies beside my bed
And the sun comes up without her
It just doesn't know she's gone

And time, time is not on your side

Feel his presence in the crowd 
Other girls they gather around him 
If I had him, I wouldn't let him out 

Goldeneye, not lace or leather 
Golden chain, take him to the spot 
Goldeneye, I'll show him forever 
It'll take forever to see what I've got 

You'll never know how I watched you from the shadows as a child 
You'll never know how it feels to get so close and be denied

When she puts her arms around me,
I can, somehow, rise above it
Yeah man, when I got that little girl standing right by my side,
You know, I can tell the whole wide world, just shove it

Hey, here comes my girl, here comes my girl,
Yeah, she looks so right, shes all I need tonight

Every now and then, I get down to the end of a day,
I have to stop, ask myself, what have I done?
It just seems so useless to have to work so hard,
And nothin' ever really seem to come from it

And then she looks m e in the eye, says, we gonna last forever,
And man, you know I cant begin to doubt it
No, because this feels so good and so free and so right,
I know we ain't never goin' change our minds about it

Hey, here comes my girl, here comes my girl, 
Here comes my girl, here comes my girl
Yeah, she looks so right, shes all I need tonight

Watch 'em walk
Yeah, every time it seems like there ain't nothin' left no more,
I find myself havin' to reach out and grab hold of somethin'
Yeah, I just catch myself wonderin', waitin', worryin'
About some silly little things that don't add up to nothin'.

And then she looks me in the eye, says, we gonna last forever,
Man, you know I cant begin to doubt it
No, because this feels so good and so free and so right,
I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it.

Hey, here comes my girl, here comes my girl,
Here comes my girl, here comes my girl

First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted with your ladies

Ok look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of ""Mr
Perfect""
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me
May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you, angels protect you
And heaven accept you.."

Skip through the blueprint one bang this what's mentioned
Bleek you're one hit away but he didn't know The Game was pitchin
Balls faster than roger Clemens nigga you're too big for your bitches
Two gold albums and I'll make you a hitter
Might make you a little richer but don't forget the big picture
All of those make you a fag but money like Little Richard
Take your faggot ass picture put it next to Gulliany
Run you for your roc-a-wear fit and beat you with the Tommy
Drag your ass down to Alby Square
Call Beans, Jay, Freeway, Biggs, Dame I'll be there
Compton behind me ask Nas queens is with me
You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin your fiends with me
My guns smoke like Robert Downey
Two shots and a pound he got a room in Kings County
And you might live or sit in a box
Depending on how long it NYPD to respond to the shot
[Chorus: The Game]
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
[Verse 2: The Game]
See what the problem is too much east coast dick lickin
And everybody tryin to do their best 2pac rendition
Listen they wonder how I live with 5 shots
Niggaz is hard to kill on my block
When you was in the streets comin of age
I was in the streets pumpin the gauge
While you was rappin I was makin it happen
On the block with a k
While you was with the roc on the stage
I had rocks on the stage
On headliner for the front page we know that you front
You be on sunset doin what? Gettin your punk ass stunt
You gon respect us or that fo' rippin through the vests
And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message
Malik or M-E-M-P-H Bleek
Fuck around and be a B-I-T-C-H sleek
Cuz all that yappin dude will get guns clappin dude
And stop Memphis from rappin dude, huh
[Chorus: The Game]
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
[Verse 3: The Game]
It took me a little while but I am now understandin
Jay fucked up in the first round when he picked olo with candy
Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me
The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans
Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch
Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris
Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef
Fans in the stand yellin out fuck Memphis Bleek
You want beef I have your body parts all over New York
Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park
You can't even borrow from New York no more like john Storch
And I ain't talkin to him I'm talkin to Malik
And I got a pine box for a nigga like you
Streets is talkin how many real niggaz like you
Hit LAX remember when you come to the coast
Niggaz don't play with they lives when it comes to the toast
[Chorus: The Game]
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek

Hell, yeah, then pass the beat

Add more killers to this entourage

Somewhere hidden in his briefcase

Dope fiends, prom queens, we too clean
Take a look you ain't ever seen
One hip-hop rapstar drop this West Coast rap-cord
Back to the spot up top
West Hills for real, give it up to him (WC)
A who bang with diamond
Take a hit with big Lajeezy before he found some wheezy
With blue Colion playin' in the backround
On the behind line with big style
Hitting P, LIG tell him let it go
Game strong, no longer in the roll
Just a few names from the respected files
LBC styles, DPG ale

My big holey stack just like that

I ain't gonna break to learn
You caught up my heart, into broken parts
Putting you against the wall
Just to heal my scar
But when it all falls down
It's taking me higher
When it all falls down
I've got the heart of a lion
Of a lion, heart of a lion, of a lion

You sure don't make it easy
To get myself to safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call me so impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive

So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you have
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
Since it's the only place you'll see my face

Oh, what you gonna do
I'm in love with you
Why don't you wanna dance

Could it be that I wasn't there?

Staring blankly into the sky
Unaffected and undistracted
Redirected to pass them by

Cold as steel underneath my broken skin
I'm bleeding
Forced to feel
Devastation murder genocide

My reflection sometimes reminds me
In their image was I born?
Technically, I'm enhanced they tell me
From their minds my existence torn
They don't know all the hate I'm feeling
They don't see how it breeds inside
I'm afraid of the walls around me
I'm afraid but I cannot hide

(Chorus)
Cold as steel underneath my broken skin
I'm bleeding
Forced to feel
Devastation murder genocide

There's a reason that I met you
It's to show me how to die
Simplify my wrong connection
Disconnect me where I lie
There is conflict all around us
There is conflict in my soul
Put an end to what's beginning
To make me want to play my role

(Chorus)
Cold as steel underneath my broken skin
I'm bleeding
Forced to feel
While I live through programmed suicide
Can?t ask why
I can't remember when I started caring
Do or die,
Devastation, murder, genocide

someone was in the pod
the tracks move off in this direction
this suit is hot. i woke up in outer space
experienced a free fall
this shit is not a free-for-all
i'm living total recall
me and all my friends are taking over past memories
overloading sensories
inventively prone
it's like attack of the clones with all these robots and drones
i hear the gears turnin' and churnin'
they burnin' out my headphones
determined not to let go
confirming there's an echo
below
in
and above and i'm returning to the threshold
never let your flesh go cold
it means you're old and dying
staring out at supernovas
feels like an ocean line
or watch as zero gravity deprives you of your body weigh
loosing all your oxygen
makes it hard to concentrate
i'm the great explorer
float around in a shuttle
touched down on solid ground so people call me p double
i see the rubble through the hubble with the lenses like sights
planet earth to major tom
so have the time of your life
when the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
i'll travel to the end of the universe and beyond
no sense of place
lost in outer space

dots on the mission
when the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
i'll travel to the end of the universe and beyond
no sense of place
lost in outer space
i'm a man's man
dots on the mission
the world in 2050
many men are shifty
floating up in outer space
many men are with me
landed on the planet earth
was an angry man at birth
was an angry man at first
stranded now i'm banded smurf
i'm a nice guy but i'm not gonna finish last
startin' to look like popeye
eat my fuckin' spinach fast
blast a droid
blast an asteroid
still a master
boy
hear me laughin' while i'm crafting up a crafty ploy
standing out like i'm an orange storm trooper
fuck a rapper like it's foreign porn
stupid
i'm the little monster
i was born super
had to kill my old self but i was torn
looper
uber awesome
blossom above the hemisphere
group of possums
not to many men i fear
my mind is totally thrashed
my heart is fuckin' broken
outspoken
hold this album like a lucky token
when the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
i'll travel to the end of the universe and beyond
no sense of place
lost without a trace
i'm a man

All the choices we made
All the stages we passed through
All the roles we played 

For so many different directions
Our separate paths might have turned
With every door that we opened
Every bridge that we burned 

Somehow we find each other
Through all that masquerade
Somehow we found each other
Somehow we have stayed
In a state of grace 

I don't believe in destiny
Or the guiding hand of fate
I don't believe in forever
Or love as a mystical state 

I don't believe in the stars or the planets
Or angels watching from above
But I believe there's a ghost of a chance
We can find someone to love
And make it last 

Like a million little crossroads
Through the back streets of youth
Each time we turn a new corner
A tiny moment of truth 

So many different connections
Our separate paths might have made
With every door that we opened
Every game we played 

Somehow we find each other
Through all that masquerade
Somehow we found each other
Somehow we have stayed

Of sweat and toil has begun.

Nine to five
Answering phones and dictating letters
Making decisions that affect no one.
Stuck in the office from nine until five
Life is so incredibly dull,
Working from nine to five.

Oh nine to five, nine to five,
Working from nine to five.

And time goes by
The hours tick away.
First seconds,
Then minutes,
Then hours into days.
Each day,
Each week,
Seems just like any other.
All work,
No play,
It's just another day.

He's caught in a mass of computerised trivia,
Deciphering data for mechanical minds.
He's lost in the paperwork and up to his eyes,
He's checking a list that's been checked out before
And he's starting to lose his mind.

A thousand miles of highway between your heart and mine

As I cross the Mississippi
You're the river flowin' in me
Comin' home, I count each heartbeat

875,indigo girls,in the bleak midwinter,Rock,en,"In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago.

Our God, heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.

Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day,
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before,
The ox and ass and camel which adore.

Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.

What can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give Him... 
Give my heart."

What makes the world go round?

How can you mend a broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow

Well, how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?

And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?

And I just have to look away
A million miles between us
Planets crash into dust
I just let it fade away
I'm walking empty streets
Hoping we might meet
I see your car parked on the road
The light on at your window
I know for sure that you're home
But I just have to pass on by
So no, of course, we can't be friends
Not while I'm still this obsessed
I guess I always knew the score
This is how our story ends
I smoke your brand of cigarettes
And pray that you might give me a call
I lie around on bed all day just staring at the walls
Hanging round bars at night
Wishing I had never been born
And give myself to anyone who wants to take me home
So no, of course, we can't be friends
Not while I still feel like this
I guess I always knew the score
This is where our story ends
You left behind some clothes
My belly summersaults
When I pick them off the floor
My friends all say they're worried
I'm looking far too skinny
I've stopped returning all their calls
And no, of course, we can't be friends
Not while I'm still so obsessed
I want to ask where I went wrong
But don't say anything at all
It took a cup of coffee
To prove that you don't love me"

893,pogues,the wake of the medusa,Rock,en,"The guests are stood in silence
They stare and drink their wine
On the wall the canvas hangs
Frozen there in time
They marvel at the beauty
The horror and despair
At the wake of the Medusa
No one shed a tear
Sit my friends and listen
Put your glasses down
Sit my friends and listen
To the voices of the drowned
In the moonlight's ghostly glow
I waken in a dream
Once more upon that raft I stand
Upon a raging sea
In my ears the moans and screams
Of the dying ring
Somewhere in the darkness
The siren softly sings
Out there in the waves she stands
And smiling there she calls
As the lightning cracks the sky
The wind begins to howl
The architects of our doom
Around their tables sit
And in their thrones of power
Condemn those they've cast adrift
Echoes down the city street
Their harpies laughter rings
Waiting for the curtain call
Oblivious in the wings
The casket is empty
Abandon ye all hope
They ran off with the money
And left us with the rope."

Cuz I don't really like ceilings
I told a bitch to get lost

So I don't really wanna see him
They picture man, the flare nigga
And all the kids wanna be him
I told that girl to get lost
Cuz I don't even like to argue
All this money that I'm makin
They think I'm playing for the Chargers
My jury game is retarded
My car game is exotic
The inside my Maserati
Cuz look like he in the hypnotic
I'm runnin from the paparazzi
But I'm in the Lamborghini
They call me Gucci Debiassi
I think I'm fucking Liberace

Such will to live and you've got so much to give,
long lost sincerity.
Lost in a world that's been scorched to black.
Lost in myself until I finally find.
A guide in you, and gratitude is mine,
I admire the way you shine.
Stare down the day from which others shield their eyes,
with complete clarity,
and no trace of apathy.
So positive, and your heart you freely give,

Far away from the crowd
All alone upon the beach
Our lips and our arms
Close within each other's reach
Will be on a moonlight swim
Let's go on a moonlight swim
To the raft we can race
After just a little while
I'll sit and pretend
That you're on a desert isle
With me on a moonlight swim
Though the air is cold
With kisses oh so sweet
I'll keep you warm
So very warm from head to you feet
Let's go on a moonlight swim
We're in love and above
There's a crazy balloon
That sits winking down
And inviting us to come on in
On a moonlight swim."

Let me show you the world in my eyes

I'll take you to the highest mountain
To the depths of the deepest sea
We won't need a map, believe me
Now let my body do the moving
And let my hands do the soothing
Let me show you the world in my eyes

That's all there is
Nothing more than you can feel now
That's all there is

Let me put you on a ship
On a long, long trip
Your lips close to my lips
All the islands in the ocean
All the heaven's in the motion

900,lil dicky,the antagonist,Pop,en,"Yeah
Ay, can y'all turn my headphones down? Significantly?
Cool, that's good
It was super loud

First of all, this shit about me
I ain't made this shit for y'all, that's the damn thing
I've been waiting pretty long to get on some shit and rip it for Dicky
So just consider this my damn theme song, baby
I've been working hella hard, though
There's people telling me I'm 'bout to be a star, bro
But when I play 'em some of this, they like nobody want the pissed Lil Dicky
You the funny kid, that's where your car go
That metaphor about my lane, if your retardo
I'm bubbling like I'm in a soda, word to Fargo
I'm tryna get the fucking fame and it's a tricky little game you gotta play
Sometimes you gotta tell your heart ""No""
Here's the problem I've been having
I wanna make my favorite type of music
And the shit I like to bump is not the type I'm brewing
I be on that ""Fuck the world, you motherfuckers losing"" type of shit
Like all you haters, look at what the fuck I'm doing
All my favorite rappers not amusing
And I love my funny stuff, I hope it's not confusing
I'm just saying, when you doing something time consuming
Every now and then you wanna spaz
Why I didn't go with jazz, muhfucka
Get up in yo ass, muhfucka
Y'all are trash, you ain't even know the half
I could rattle off a lot of opposition to rap game
But honestly I'm not in the position for that plane
To carry any weight, I just gotta carry on and wait
'Til a motherfucker carry all the weight
Hypothetically, though, I prolly tell you that I'm better than you'll ever be bro
I prolly tell you it's objective, I'm more impressive
You pressing play, and form a perspective
I'm guessing more or less it won't be competitive
Y'all adorable, seditive kind of rappers, so deplorably editive
Nothing's worse than when a moron's repetitive
I don't get it, how is everyone the same dude?
The rookie walking on the court like ""Man, I can't lose""
They playing Dicky, everybody in the room be like ""That's some shit""
Playing yo bum ass, they be like ""That's some shit""
Y'all are bubbles with the rapping
Lil Dicky get it popping, you could say he bubble rapping
The irony in all of this is I've been funny rapping
Yet the youngin's snapping to the point where all of y'all are funny rapping
Congratulations, y'all can write a hook
At my graduation, they was saying I could write a book
If a Rotten Tomatoes site existed for us rappers
I would be a 97, y'all would hover 'round a 64
Little Dicky spit that Pixar
Hope you seeing why I really like to spit hard
Only problem is I'm rapping to rappers
To the people that be listening, that world doesn't matter
Wanna know what the advantage of the rapper who black is?
The N-word is his antagonist
Before you get all huff and puff about it, think about it, be analyst
The fact they always use it's no accident
For example, I could be like ""Go figure
I don't think I'm one to fuck with all you ho...""
Y'all can fill in the blank
But that don't make it so you don't gotta rap at a rapper
That applies to every detractor
But even if I had a word like it, the nerd never disturbed
It's absurd but I'm looking 'round and ain't nobody verse me
I don't think a motherfucker's ever tried to hurt me
Every one I see has been supportive on this journey
Like where my haters at? I'm thirsty
I just really wanna talk my shit, be like ""Y'all ain't shit""
But y'all ain't shit, like, y'all don't exist
I could talk about the people that are dicks but I feel like that's whack
That'll get old quick, Robin Williams in ""Jack""
Who the fuck is my antagonist?
Is it you? Is it you?
If it's you, let me tell you something
You ain't even got a clue 'bout the shit that's coming
You don't wanna be the dude in five years like
""The fuck, I dissed that
Shit was pretty clear, how the fuck I missed that?""
You know that I ain't fucking light, bruh
I just fucked around and did this overnight, bruh
I just fucked around and quit a fucking job where I was making triple digits then the comma got involved, dawg
This wasn't rapping or trapping
This was rapping or a big ol' fucking house with a family
Who the fuck is listening that's been making Dicky so angry?
Is it you? Is it you?
I'm just waiting on some nonbelievers
The writing isn't on the wall, it's coming out your speakers
Anybody disagree, I'm being so facetious, homie I mean it
Forget the website, I'm the only motherfucking rap genius
Where you doubters at, I'm tryna hear it
Maybe it's the motherfuckers never paying mind to lyrics
I would dumb it down for y'all to try make it more appealing
But the ones who hang on every word think I'm kinda peerless
But even with no attention, you can kinda tell this motherfucker killing this section
You can kinda tell this motherfucker still an erection
But getting harder by the minute, just admit it, it's sexy
The funny fact about this shit, 
I gotta rap about the fact I wanna rap about this shit to even rap about this shit
Nobody been sleeping on Dicky
It's only been a year and bitches been sleeping on Dicky
Nobody took over the game with they first tape
This motherfucker hasn't struggled since the first grade
Add it up, there's no excuse to go berserk, Dave
Can't debate this shit, you got to skip, you not on first take
So what the fuck am I mad for?
What's some other shit that I could actually spaz for?
Maybe it's the fact that I've been stuck in this lab for
A hundred fucking days straight cooking up raps or
The fact this shit been taking over every thing in life
I gotta make it so I made the call to leave it all behind
That's my girl, that's my world, that's beyond being busy
Now the only one that gets to David Burd is Lil Dicky

See, I told you this about me
Go on and look up in the mirror, see with LD
Who you hate, boy?
Only care about me, said I'm straight, boy
Maybe I'm the one that gotta hit when I wanna murder shit
Y'all probably thinking ""Who is David Burd?"" and shit
Y'all just wanna hear some LD
But I ain't made this shit for y'all, that's the damn thing"

You know you look even better
Than the way you did night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips
You know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know
To escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you
And I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free
Ohhh
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
I know, I was with you last night
But it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they know
That I'm not myself when you gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh
Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Don't look down, don't you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone
Moonshine, take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh
Moonshine, your love it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time"

Or something you always had to fake

It's not the days when you leave me
But all I fear are the nights
But all I fear are the nights

I wish that someone would hit it
Just before you reach
Just before you reach
Just before you reach the punchline

And a gleaming metal tube
Would stretch all the way from the highlands
Back to La Brea.

On his way to make a pickup
Turned off the air-con
Rolled down the window
And began to sweat
Out over the Hollywood hills
He saw the clouds building
Like great dark towers of rain
Ready to come tumbling down
Any day now
Not a day too soon

It ain't the drill at a hun', it ain't the people we're chasing
Or these bitches that you came to toot, is basically basic
I'm getting white boy wasted, I'm waking up with a poor start
She walking around naked like she my personal all star
I push one button and boom: ""hey, baby, how can I serve you today? ""
Pussy wet like a typhoon. Ass is unreal, it look like a cartoon
Immaculate back stroll, anal and deep throat
Whatever the fuck I want you get to make it happen
Powder her nose and she never take a break in the action
Shit, I'm about to miss my flight
First class to London, fucking with you all night

[Chorus]
Act up in this motherfucker, spending all my money on her
Because I don't care blowing kush in the air
Dropping car, feeling like spaceships
Riding with models and stripping ace in the club
Show international girls how to do it with dub
While my chain swing left to right
Came with the party with you, do it all night
My money never run out, we party 'till the sun out
We have Patron shots, so we know we're about to come out

From west to uncut, working at home
From BJ to YJ, now the J grown
One click of the wrist, I compare her to gun flight patrol
On your turn flight to predator draw more
Not to mention Pitbull bully razor heads
Bloodline, Wu-Tang fans, police
Stupid, get it right, off the chain for a fight
Or the flash green lights meeting at your door sight
Let's go to war now, off the world is steady
Wake up to your nightmare, Freddy Krueger's ready
Want your fingers sliced, now you pay the price
Put your light on the line if you feel get that nice
Running bullshit over here, get you shot
Stupid, I retreat that, everything you're not
Exits more the spot, that's everything that's hot
Walk right upon you and run everything you've got

[Chorus]

I, I, I hit 'em with a nuke, get the pussy
They're scared to shoot
My niggas get you with the 21 gun, salute
I paratroop to your city, hit the club, recruit
Let's see some titties
Boogie words for shitty birds, I learn from the smartest
Treat the bitch like a bitch, treat the queen like a goddess
I coast it, bum bought it, weighting me down
Sleight the razor to your throat, what can you say to me now?
This is dope out above law, thousands of pounds
Keep the crowd in a chokehold, deliver the rounds
I'm going from living with clowns to rocking a crown
It protect my self silence oppressed the sound
You was up a body violence, working jaw to the ground
Making how you got knocked down the talk of the town
Stick around for the fireworks, apocalypse now
Hear it out, make them dollars work, smoking that loud

politicians speaking in some solemn tone, the crisis of a different world,

We'll fight it out to see it through
I say that you won't bee too much fun for us
Though it's oh so nice to get advice it's oh so hard to do

936,usher,love you gently,Pop,en,"Verse 1
First see the city skylights shining from my room
You’re such a sight to see in the month of June
Beautiful like the moon’s reflection when
It’s passing off your skin
And before you let me in
I hear you say
It’s been a long time
I say OK K K don’t worry I got you
Do ya say
How bout some foreplay
Got that, got plenty, I got you
Do ya say
Play some slow ones
Got that Sade, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye too
To love you gently
Chorus
Let me love you gently
Lay back relax, Girl I’ma be
Light as a feather but hard as a rock
Cause daddy know just what you like
Gonna love you gently
Light as feather but hard as a rock
Verse 2
See I know just when to finish
And I know just when to start
And I’ll be lovin your reaction
Every time I hit that spot
Gently
Bottom soft like leather
Gently
But the top is hard
Gently
Whisper your pleasures
Gently
Then I’ll do my job
Invigorating, intense
Girl let me do what I do
I don’t know what’s echoing louder
The music or you
Gently
I ain’t close to be done yet
Gently
But your getting real warm
Gently
Like the calm of the thunder
Gently
Right after the storm
You say, you say, do you say it girl
Make it
Gonna push it to the limit
It's yours, It's yours
See second place or win the race
I’m gonna be your number one
Til the sun shines
Here comes the sun
Forever more
Let’s try and taste the moon again forever more
Chorus
Let me touch you gently
Light as feather but hard as a rock
Gonna love you gently
Light as a feather but hard as a rock
Can you feel me girl
We don’t need no room
All we need is me and you
Wanna love you"

When I can't stand myself?
I'm tired to be honest..
I'm nobody.
Perfect in weakness.
I'm only perfect in just your strength alone.
Perfect in weakness.
I'm only running in just your strength alone.

It's on again, young niggas born again
I wish somebody coulda told me then
That we was gon' grow up to be some lonely men
Now I found out I really don't got friends
Cause nobody come around when I not spend
I walk around this fuckin planet feelin boxed in
Smokin stoge after stoge like it's oxygen
When there was 10 of us we all ate from one dub
Let's turn the dirt to glory for Pac up above
Yak one love, I know you gotta be free
Havin conversations with you when there's nobody but me
I guess whatever don't kill me make me stronger
But I don't know if I can take it any longer
But I got to, cause family live they dreams through us
It's like 5 million lost souls that cling to us
But I know one thing, it ain't shit without y'all
Thug Life for life, Young Noble Outlaw
It ain't shit without y'all
Thug Life for life, Young Noble Outlaw

[ CHORUS: Noble ]
The only thing that we got left is us
If you don't have nothin else, son, you got my trust
Loyalty come first, I put my life in your hands
I'ma die as a man and die together is the plan
Keep the team stong, make this cream real long
Cash last long enough for our grandkids to eat on
We Outlawz, and if it's on then it's on
Watch my back, I watch yours and we make it through the strorm
Thug on

Early on I knew life wasn't shit
Just made 2, drugs and love made my daddy split
Mama's now forced to turn a boy into a man
Impossible task, still she doin all she can
And I'm growin quickly, slowly started seein things
All the wrong in this world, taught me not to believe in things
Not even man, cause we all change daily
Best friends be tryin to bring each other death quickly
Only the strong survive
As long as I'm alive I ride
Hooked up with some niggas that I knew had my side
O-you-t-l-a-w-z
Me for you, you for me eternally
Makaveli-trained riders
Cause the Don may be gone but he remains deep inside us
It comes out every time niggas try us
y'all my family until the Lord'll have me I make this promise

[ CHORUS: Young Noble ]

[ Napoleon ]
I been wakin up, stressin lately
Sheets wet from the sweat and my hands shaky
I got a kid on the way, I'm kinda nervous
I did some dirt in my life, hope it don't curse it
And all I got left is my Outlaw niggas
My cousins and my brothers and some Jersey drug dealers
I keep my faith in the Lord and stay strugglin
He keep on pushin me forward to stay hustlin
And when Pac died nobody never knew
Or gave a fuck on what the Outlawz was goin through
We kept your heads to the sky and our guns too
We had to ask straight for a dollar to split a cold brew
And through the process our family was still dyin
I got a grip of this shit, there's no complyin
And I'ma be the solid rock that I am, nigga
And I'ma give it all I got to raise my kid, nigga
I got the blood of Malcolm X in me
I got the dirt from the cemetery runnin in me
One way up and that's how we goin, nigga
Now put guns up, the world ain't friendly, nigga
And just wait till you get to hold reality
And just wait, I bet you try to up your salary
And these crackers be doin too much
Let's start the revolution so we can rise up
Come on

Dropped out of schools cause of things I never learned

And I never thought there'd be any help
For somebody like me

Some chapters and some verses, you seek and you find
Look no further here I go, Big Will, Johnny Inferno

942,out of eden,paradise,R&B,en,"I tuned in to the tv once again today
Watch the news to educate my mind
The destruction and the chaos that confronted me
It's our world caught in it's own demise
(As I sat there I began to cry)
The situation worsens every day that goes by
(And I thought how can this be, Lord why)
So heavy on me all those that are hurting inside

If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken
For every word of love unspoken
For every childhood dream that's never realize
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing
And all the ways we could be moving on
Maybe I could buy you paradise
Just to see some hope in your eyes

Sometimes life it seems a bit too much for me
More things we must survive on top of all that we had before
Broken hearts, broken homes, kids abused left alone
So many in the streets, homeless with no food to eat
(I know God hears us crying out)
Run to Him for all the answers, don't turn away
(If we look to Him there is no doubt)
He'll give us all the help we need, he knows the way, still if I

If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken
For every word of love unspoken
For every childhood dream that's never realize
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing
And all the ways we could be moving on
Maybe I could buy you paradise
Just to see some hope in your eyes

There are so many troubles, God knows what we need to do
He has us in His hands, knows what we are going through
Silver and gold have I none, what I have I give to you
His word says we can make it and I know His word is true
Here's to the hurting souls and for all the broken hearts
All those who've been abused, who's life has been torn apart
I don't have all the answers, what I have I gladly give
It's in him there is life, if in him we live and if I

If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken
For every word of love unspoken
For every childhood dream that's never realize
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing
And all the ways we could be moving on
Maybe I could buy you paradise
Just to see some hope in your eyes"

With the living night
And the darkness at high noon

There is never love without pain
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart
Out of sync
With the rhythm of my own reactions
With the things that last
And the things that come apart

A healing hand, a secret touch on the heart
There is never love without pain
Life is a power that remains."

Unfriendliness chilling my body
And whispering pictures of home

Wondering blindly
How can they find me
Maybe they don't even know
My body is shaking
Anticipating
The call of the black footed crow

I'm alone here
With emptiness eagles and snow
Unfriendliness chilling my body
And taunting with pictures of home

Here in this prison
Of my own making
Year after day I have grown
Into a hero
But there's no worship
Where have they hidden my throne?

Unfriendliness chilling my body
And screaming out pictures of home"

With a pocket full of big-faced visa's
They say its cheaper to keep her now baby ease up,
Kick back and blaze some of these trees up.
And now sit your ass in the trees-ah
And do me a favor and turn the music up.
Should I slap her, or should I freak up?
I'll take the strong and you can have the weak-ah.

Had to catch my breath, watch my step.
Playin this game, you can holla at the ref.
And call a time-out
before you put your dime out.
Stop, pause, rewind, before you put your rhyme out.
And go to the Wizard of Oz
to tell him that u r tryin to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
cause you realized you had never played your part
and that was smart.
It's like a art the way I ar-tic-ulate
And break these bitches from state to state.
See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate

Our past days were the fun
This endgame is the one

959,elton john,social disease,Rock,en,"Music by Elton John
Lyrics by Bernie Taupin
Available on the album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road

My bulldog is barking in the backyard
Enough to raise a dead man from his grave
And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing
Disturbance going to crucify my days
And the days they get longer and longer
And the nighttime is a time of little use
For I just get ugly and older
I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose

And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinner time and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

My landlady lives in a caravan
Well that is when she isn't in my arms
And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness
But my liquor also helps to grease her palms

And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams."
960,yellowcard,a place we set afire,Pop,en,"You feel it
You boxed it by the youth you left behind
Does anybody see you anymore?
But if we can get free
There's a big bright world to see
Forget about the way it felt before
Try to breathe the air that's here and now
Try to find some peace in falling out
We don't have to say goodbye
But we can't get lost in time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Maybe in another life
You tell me there must be
A little light left flickering
Burning in a place we set afire
But no one will listen
If we just wait here to burn
We've gotta swing away, gotta cut the wire
Try to breathe the air that's here and now
Try to find some peace in falling out
We don't have to say goodbye
But we can't get lost in time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Maybe in another life
We don't have to say goodbye
But we can't get lost in time
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Maybe in another life
We don't have to say goodbye
I'll be yours and you'll be mine"

But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning

There's no need to watch the bridges that were burning

Lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time for the good times

I'll get along you'll find another
I'll be here if you should find you ever need me

This is what you get
When you're talking back baby
I never bounce a check
So give it up baby

Open up your eyes
I want to watch you cry
Come on come on

Now I'm a changed man

And we shared some high times

He would sing a few of my own

These emotional transitions
All the memories we've had
Yes, you know it's true
I just can't stop thinking of you
No I just can't pretend

Wanna feel it again
All the love we felt then

Dietro gli steccati degli orgogli suoi
Sto pensando a te
Sto pensando a noi
Sono cose della vita
Vanno prese un po' cosi
Some for worse and some for better
But through it all we've come so far
Gia...come vedi
Io sto ancora in piedi perche
Sono umani tutti i sogni miei
Con le mani io li prenderei, si perchè
What's life without a dream to hold?
Take my hand and never let me go
It's part of life together
But what future does it hold?
Sono cose della vita
Ma la vita poi dov'e

Love breaks your heart, to teach you to be strong
I die, just a little, so I can live a little bit more"

In a little creepy place
Little creepy town
In a little creepy world

Saying funny things that you have never heard
Do you know what it's all about?
Are you brave enough to figure out?
Know that you could set your world on fire
If you are strong enough to leave your doubts
Feel it
Breathe it
Believe it
And you'll be walking on air
Go try
Go fly
So high
And you'll be walking on air
You feel this
unless you kill this
Go on
And you're forgiven
I knew that
I could feel that
I feel like
I am walking on air
She has a little creepy cat
And a little creepy bat
Little rocking chair and an old blue hat
That little creepy girl
Oh she loves to sing
She has a little gift
An amazing thing
With her little funny eyes of hazel
With her little funny old blue hat
She will go and set the world on fire

I messed up and I know it if I hurt you girl I'm sorry
But it's good to see the girl I used to know
We can dance but I can't dance
Maybe we can stick to holding hands
Or should we raise a glass
And forget the past
If we keep up on drinkin' we gonna fall back in love

[Trina]
I woke up around ten o'clock this morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Put on my French-lace panties and my Enyce warm-up
I said, ""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the baddest bitch of them all?""
There was a quick pause
Then the mirror responded, ""You know you got it locked stop actin' retarded.""
Fa sho, that's why these bitches don't want beef
Cause I, flash the Roley with the all yellow deese
Got the sunflower-yellow on the fingernails
And the yellow Louie bag with the pastels
Yo I'm livin' like a model while my rap sales (Why?)
Cause niggaz love the way my back swells
Plus I show my ladies how to mack males
Fuck posin' for BlackTail, I'm bout to sign a PlayBoy deal, unh

Every sunflower, cloud and every tree

Nature's got me high and it's beautiful
I'm with this deep eternal universe
From death until rebirth
This corner of the earth is like me in many ways
I can sit for hours here and watch the emerald feathers play
On the face of it I'm blessed
When the sunlight comes for free
I know this corner of the earth it smiles at me
So inspired of that there's nothing left to do or say
Think I'll dream, 'til the stars shine
The wind it whispers and the clouds don't seem to care
And I know inside, that it's all mine
It's the chorus of the breakin' dawn
The mist that comes before the sun is born
To a hazy afternoon in May
Nature's got me high and it's so beautiful
I'm with this deep eternal universe from death until rebirth
You know that this corner of the earth is like me in many ways
I can sit for hours here and watch the emerald feathers play
On the face of it I'm blessed

I know this corner of the earth it smiles at me

No retreat, baby, no surrender
Like soldiers on the winter's night
With a vow to defend
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Well, now young faces grow sad and old
And hearts of fire grow cold
We swore blood brothers against the wind
And I'm ready to grow young again
And I hear your sister's voice calling us home
Across the open yards
Well even we can cut someplace of our own
With these drums and these guitars
'Cause we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Blood brothers on a summer's night
With a vow to defend
No retreat, baby, no surrender
Now out on the streets tonight the lights are growing dim
And the walls of my room are closing in
But it's good to see your smiling face
And to hear your voice again
Now we can sleep in the twilight
By the river bed
With a wide open country in our hearts
And these romantic dreams in our hands

Blood brothers on a summer's night

Someone who'll watch over me

I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me
