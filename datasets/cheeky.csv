rage against the machine,clampdown,Metal,en,"What are we gonna do now?
Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew?
'Cause they're working for the clampdown
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you+ACE-
When we're working for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers
The judge said five to ten-but I say double that again
I'm not working for the clampdown
No man born with a living soul
Can be working for the clampdown
Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
D'you know that you can use it?
The voices in your head are calling
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming
Only a fool would think someone could save you
The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothing, so boy get runnin'
It's the best years of your life they want to steal
You grow up and you calm
down
You're working for the clampdown
You start wearing the blue and brown
You're working for the clampdown
So you got someone to boss around
It makes you feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
You made your first kill now
In these days of evil presidentes
Working for the clampdown
But lately one or two has fully paid their due
For working for the clampdown
But ha Gitalong Gitalong
And I've given away no secrets
Who's barmy now?."
the tragically hip,'use it up',Indie,en,"Use it up
Use it all up
Don't save a thing for later
If there's music out there laying in wait
To pounce and drain every ounce if you
Wait or hesitate
And music that'll help you be tough
And come together on more than
Springsteen
Though most days it's been enough
Then there's music that can take you away
Away
Away
Away

So use it up
Use it all up
Don't save a thing for later
Use it up
Use it all up
Don't save a thing for later

If there's music out there staying awake
To cry and drain every eye until
Hatred's eliminated
And music that can help you feel great
And come together in 'the fictive dream'
With a kind of Randy Newman take
There's music that can take you away
Away
Away
Away
Where we can jump to our feet, agape
Cause nothing is cruel
And even if it is or was
Indefeasibly cruel
We don't care because
Yer a fool
I'm a fool
Yer a fool
And I'm a fool
For music that can take you away
For music that can take you away
For music that can take you away

So use it up
Use it all up
Don't save a thing for later"
judee sill,waterfall,Folk,en,"I've heard the waterfall roaring again
Since I've been lovin' you
With my poor heart in my throat I begin
Living a dream come true
Tumblin' down comes the waters
Tickling every stone
On the edge trembling, I totter
My fate unknown
But my fear has flown

Cause' your love came to lead me home
Waterfall song in my head
Prasin' its thunderous swords
Just as my heart praises you and me here
True love's the wondrous force
Tumblin' down comes the waters
Tickling every stone
Rumbling gravity falters
Since dawn has shown
How nice overthrown
And love comes to lead us home
From a small trickle it grows
Watching a waiting front
Til its momentum will carry the flow
Over the rushing falls
Tumbling down comes the waters
Tickling every stone
Pass the sun's rays growin' hotter
The cascades drones 
Through glistening falls
Like love comes to lead us home"
the stone roses,waterfall,Rock,en,"Chimes sing Sunday morn
Today's the day she's sworn
To steal what she never could own
And race from this hole she calls home

Now you're at the wheel
Tell me how, how does it feel?
So good to have equalized
To lift up the lids of your eyes

As the miles they disappear
See land begin to clear
Free from the filth and the scum
This American satellites won

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall

See the steeple pine
The hills as old as time
Soon to be put to the test
To be whipped by the winds of the west

Stands on shifting sands
The scales held in her hands
The wind it just whips her and waits
And fills up her brigantine sails

She'll carry on through it all
She's a waterfall
She'll carry on through it all

She's a waterfall"

What kinda woman is that?

She move a crazy man
Who say ""now I'm not so dumb"" 
I take her to a funeral boy
The dead jumped up to run 
She look at a deaf and dumb boy
Said ""now I can speak"" 
She shook her finger in a blind man's face
""Once was blind but now I see""

soraya ,reason to believe,Pop,en,"Saw a vision in the middle of the day
Reality slipped a million miles away
As my mind wandered its spirit embraced me
And brought me closer to this reason to believe 

Got a handful of burning questions
Living with the burden of good intentions
Having spent years reading between the lines
Hoping something would stir my mind

I've been looking for a reason
I've been searching for a way
For a reason to believe
For a way to be set free 

When I was a girl
And everything was still on my side
The urgencies of certain things were
Hugging at my side
Now the clock is ticking harder 
And the years are spinning by
Faster than I should want them to I find myself struggling
Against the same old fears
Through the years remained true

I've been looking for a reason
I've been searching for a way
For a reason to believe for a way to be set free
I've been looking for a reason
I've been searching for a way
For a reason to believe
For a way to be set free"
marilyn manson,mechanical animals,Metal,en,"We were neurophobic and perfect
The day that we lost our souls
Maybe we weren't so human
But if we cry we will rust
And I was a hand grenade
That never stopped exploding
You were automatic
And as hollow as the ""o"" in God
I am never gonna be the one for you
I am never gonna save the world from you
They'll never be good to you, bad to you
They'll never be anything
Anything at all
You were my mechanical bride
A phenobarbidoll
A manniqueen of depression
With the face of a dead star
And I was a hand grenade
That never stopped exploding
You were automatic
And as hollow as the ""o"" in God
I am never gonna be the one for you
I am never gonna save the world from you
They'll never be good to you, bad to you
They'll never be anything
Anything at all
I am never gonna be the one for you
I am never gonna save the world from you
This isn't me I'm not mechanical
I'm just a boy playing the suicide king

half moon run,no more losing the war,Indie,en,"Somebody stop her 
The lifter 
The runner 
The girl with the gold in her mouth

Waterloo station 
Strung up on a Ferris wheel

""pick of the litter"" 
The newspapers screamed from their racks 
Pictures at seven, nine-teen eighty-something 
The waltz on her father's shoes

In an after-pub-closing way 
Falling down, crawling drunk laughing like children with sugared up gullets

No more losing the war, Karen 
Oh Karen

No more losing the war 

You got me all frustrated 
In an old fashioned way 

Easy does it rider 
I've had a long, long day 

No more losing the war, Karen 
No more losing the war, Karen"
janet jackson,empty,Pop,en,"How could it be
That you know me
My deepest fears
My fantasies
Confide in you
What no one knows
But it feels so good

Chorus:
When I close my eyes
I can see your face
When I lick my lips
I can taste your smile
When I see your name
My heart starts to race
If I can't read your thought
Then I feel empty

Is this a new
Way to love
Never face to face
Is it enough
Does it really count
Or am I a fool
So tell me please
Am I wasting my time

Your phrases
Descriptive
And though the textured words
With beauty
You post it
And use such colored verbes
We've never meet

Repeat Chorus

I'm rushin' home
To turn you on
Sometimes you're there
Sometimes you're gone
Wait for hours
For your return
So tell me please
Am I wasting my time

Your phrases
Descriptive
And though the textured words
With beauty
You post it
And use such colored verbes
So tell me

You think that
Maybe we're gone insane
To find a, a lover
And thought the words of pain
We never meet

supertramp,an awful thing to waste,Rock,en,"You say that you could do with a break
Had about all you can take
You need to find somewhere you can run to
Somewhere a long way from here
Somewhere where the skies are all clear
Somewhere you can think all your thoughts through
It took a long time to make me understand
You gotta meet life and shake it by the hand
You gotta use your emotion
You talk a nice line to put your mind at ease
You want to sit back and count your memories
But that's no solution
I don't want to harp about it
But what you gonna do about it?
Look at how you're set in your ways
You used to be so willing to face
Any kind of problem before you
Life is not as long as you think
Open up your mind and you'll see
Don't destroy yourself I implore you
You've got a fine wife, a perfect family
You had it all planned to live so carefully
But where does it get you
They say the mind is an awful thing to waste
And that's a fact that you must come to face
What more can I tell you?
I don't want to harp about it
But what you gonna do about it?
You have everything you that need
You only have to try to succeed
And realize it's all waiting for you
Living life this way is a bust
If you have to suffer you must
Don't you know we want to applaud you"

Fell in love out of college
Good man for a bad year
Visions of sugarplums and boxes of roses
All my girlfriends cried, and I was outta here

Whoa, whoa, everybody's just getting by

Took us all the way to state back in '85
Shining moment and a dusty reminder
He felt so scared, never felt so alive
But now there's toys in the backyard
Daddy's boys; you know how they like to fight
When they sleep, he swears they're angels
He wouldn't trade a day for all those Friday nights

In a place of dark can we see the light

Tryin' to feel my feet and regain my powers
Livin' on the flight path, tryin' to feel the ground
Tryin' to break the chains that hold me to this town

I've been watchin' the crows, sittin' on the wires
Listenin' to the muscle cars burnin' their tires
I thought I'd stick around for a month or so
Well I've been here for seven and this is what I know

You can read a lot of books, it don't make you smart
Kiss a lot of fools, don't mean you got a heart
Walk a million miles, don't mean that you traveled
You can make a perfect plan, and see it all unravel

Well you know who your friends are when you go through trouble
They're the ones who come around and pull you from the rubble
The phone don't ring as many times a day
But when it does, they have somethin' good to say

I watch the new mothers push their strollers on my street
They're scared and they're happy and they're sad and they're sweet
I watched two seasons come and go
And this is what I know

You can read a lot of books, it don't make you smart
Kiss a lot of fools, don't mean you got a heart
Walk a million miles, don't mean that you traveled
You can make a perfect plan, and see it all unravel

Now I'm sittin' in the window and I'm watchin' it rain
Thunder and lightenin', love and shame
It took me four long years to crawl down to this place
It'll take four to get back and it ain't no race

Now there's cats on the sidwalk, dogs under trees
And the wheels on the pavement buzz like honey bees
The laundry's wet and the wind is gonna blow
And I don't care 'cause this is what I know

You can read a lot of books, it don't make you smart
Kiss a lot of fools, don't mean you got a heart
Walk a million miles, don't mean that you traveled
You can make a perfect plan, and see it all unravel"

Shivering bowl, a flickering friend

See, that's Mr. Murphy, my leathery brave
He's whimpering ""Taps"" now, for his plank-walk grade

I've never been a joiner, no, I've quit every team I've been on

Now I'm crying in my coffee, that's not sea salt in my eyes
'Cause me and Murphy, we have been through it, and I hate watching him die

So I wait for my wisdom, like I wait for my wife
Like I wait for a story, helps me wait out the night

Like when I was an archer, but I couldn't shoot straight
I broke all of ma's windows, I poked holes through her drapes

And I laugh to myself, but I can't tell you why
The hung-over sun, sneaks back in the sky

But Murphy went peaceful, he went decent and right
At least better than I will, when it's my turn to die

And I wear his collar on my wrist
And I bury him down at the beach

No crying, no coffin, just a body and a hole
No praying, no singing, no saving any souls

The only thing I'm saving, yeah
Is a bone inside a bowl"

One tear hit the hard wood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can't get it back

For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring rain drops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step and said
I see the way out, and I'm gonna take it

I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waiting to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted

Another glass of whiskey but it still don't kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday

A feeling warm and smooth and fine

You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill
I felt like grabbin' you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
But all I could do were stand there paralyzed
Oh yeah lucky me, Iâ€™m singing ev'ry day
Ever since that day you came my way
You made my life for me just one big happy game
I'm gay ev'ry morning
At night Iâ€™m still the same
Do you remember that wonderful time
You held my hand and swore that you'll be mine
In front of preacher you said
""I do"" I couldn't say a word for thinking of you."

Ho-o-ome Back to the hills with the whippoorwills Of ho-o-ome With the fireflies blinkin' and the night stars winkin' Ho-o-ome Honeysuckle vine and Muscadine wine At ho-o-ome Where the ginseng grows in the shady groves of ho-o-ome With family and friends and joy that never ends Ho-o-ome There's no place like it, no place like it Ho-ome"

I want you to know that
We're dancing over here
since the moon is gone
I sweat
I shake on the saturday night
'Cause my soul isn't freezing
and your body is my hype
I sing : ""You and Brigit Bardot""
A new melody for an old song
My heart belongs to you
and it beats softly with this song
(Just like the way you make me feel)
You never get me down,
when you sing that song:
Se ela não voltasse atrás naquele dia claro...
é claro que eu vou voltar a cantar.
Não adianta nem pensar se ela não mais voltar
com tanta inocência plena.
Das garotas
As garotas...
O que me importa mesmo é um devaneio.
Nem quero saber se você gosta mesmo de mim

de uma tarde à toa.
Jogado na praia.
Jogado ao leo, ao vento.
Uma tarde, um dia, a doce vida."

Do you think that we will go there,
And see what makes it shine, Mary Margaret?
It's almost morning, and we've talked all night,
You know we've made big plans for ten-year-olds,
You and I.

Have you met my new boy friend, Margaret?
His name is John, and he rides my bus to school,
And he holds my hand.
He's fourteen, he's my older man.
But we'll still be the best of friends,
The three of us, Margaret, John, and I.

Let's go to New York City, Margaret!
We'll hide out in the subways
And drink the poets' wine, oh,
But I had John, so you went and I stayed behind.
But you were home in time for the senior prom,
When we lost John.

The fantasies we plan, I'm living them now.
All the dreams we sang when we knew how,
Well, they haven't changed.
There's never been two friends like you and me,
Mary Margaret.

It's nice to see you family growing, Margaret.
Your daughter and your husband there,
They really treat you right,
But we've talked all night
And what about the light, that glowed beyond
Our woods when we were ten?
You were the rambler then.

The fantasies we planned, well, Maggie,
I'm living them now.
All the dreams we sang, oh, we damn sure knew
How, but I haven't changed.
There'll never be two friends like you and me,
Maggie, can't you see?

There's a light beyond your woods, Mary Margaret."

And you'll keep what's yours ?cause that would only be fair
But what about the heart that we both created together?

[Chorus]
We used to be the toast of the town
We used to have the best love of all
We had blue skies but they came falling down
What happened to us

You and I once were lovers
No cheating hearts and no one did wrong
So why did we break, can't say our love wasn't strong
But I know with time things that start to mend

So let's fix these hearts so they can't be broken again
You need a man who sees how lonely you've been
don't worry, I will start all over and then
We will get back the heart that we both created together

Last night I cried but girl you were not here
So it was just a big waste of tears
But then I smiled, I heard your voice in my ear
Tellin' me you wish it could be like it was in the beginning

While on their coffee break

Ok my coffee break is me time, basically that's weed time
My co-worker man she's fine, walks by I beeline
In pursuit with no deny I'm on that ass like Levi's
I told my boss to fuck off, middle finger no peace sign (bitch)
[Verse 1]
Break time, so break that down
Roll it up go head pass that around
Light it up till they passing out
Flow is rough, go head ask about
Rip up tracks, lap around
Laugh about how we I'm macking now
Herbals out by the pound
Are loud as fuck bitch how that sound?
Drugs out here like gold
I'm representing my home
Marietta I am so blown
So don't let me get in my zone
She's reluctant of my brand, you know these dudes in bands
Like my women like my coffee though, sweet and tan
Shawty, ugh, yup she's falling for it
Jumped on train yup all aboard
I Spit slick like olive oil
But she don't spit she swallow all
She got me
Heart is beating like rocky
I fell in love just stop me
Wait that's probably all of this molly
I need some water; I think I took too much
So somebody call a doctor, I think my heart just stop
But check out my roster, and no this isn't luck
I like my woman like my coffee, hot as fuck

Break time, so break it down
Make time, make you bounce
Take mine, go head make my rounds
Cake time lets make these pounds
Shake down, get you out
Fuck that skirt, loose that blouse
8 times, I think it went down
Wait 9..
I lost count
Ok, ill admit I'm in a daze
Last couple days been a haze
When I blazed everything in my way
Like a rat in a maze and I made it out now bitch I'm amazed
Often baked on my coffee break
Often late when I contemplate
Your talk is great but it's awkwardly
Marvin Gaye, no chardonnay
I'm Back at it with a flow so sick
Sick as fuck they don't hope I live
Wordsmith you better hope I miss
I'm High as fuck ayo co pilot
Woodstock like Joan Biaz
Count me out well they so biased
Sleeping on me how dope I is
Fuck all ya'll (Hold My Dick)
Run and tell yo how I kill these beats
They love me up in languages that I don't speak
Ok she was so intrigued I think she's form Belize
So yes you can believe she was screaming (hi papi)
And though it was intense I ain't spoken to her sense
She even told her friends around me to watch her step
I'm dressed up to the 9's and She's looking like a 10
I met her at 11, and by 12 I was in"

Of you not loving me
It doesn't help me to complain
I just have to feel it
And hope it goes away


But it's so useless and it hurts just like it did before I'm afraid that I'll close up inside
And no longer feel anything anymore


It's such a strange need to be deprived of
To just want love and feel happy

I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul to waste

And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain

I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah
Ah, what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah

I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the gods they made

I shouted out,
Who killed the Kennedys?
When after all
It was you and me

Let me please introduce myself

Who get killed before they reached Bombay

And all the sinners saints
As heads is tails
Just call me Lucifer
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint

So if you meet me
Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste

Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah

Hope you guessed my name, mm yeah

Still in the bathtub, damn this was a dirty bitch, must of fucked another nigga last night. So what, I was with a bitch so everything was alright. Pulled up bumping the mutherfucking Cube. Walked in the door seen my face on the tube. Stood there and tripped off the gaffle video. It went off, I looked up and said its time to go. Girl said she was hungry so I tried not to be evil. I said you got a choice, Louie's burgers or Golden Eagle. She started biffing, I said bitch i ain't playing. It ain't like your my woman, why'knowutumsaying? Girl got the grub and it was off to the liqour store. I said what kind of drinks, she said go with the 4-0 I said what? grab one or two? She said get two, one for me and one for you. Got her to the room and she started to guzzling the forty, hit the blunt and the bitch was buzzing. that's when I told her it was time to come to Eiht. And I was about to bounce, rock, roll, and skate. Got inside, got to spanking on that ass. Her engine got hot, she start moving real fast. that's when I knew, she started to feel it. I grabbed them shoulders, said 'geah, can I kill it.' Geah, still breaking them off, why'knowutumsaying. Baby, why'knowutumsaying, ain't no faking. I'm here to break you off proper. All them other niggas be drag, why'knowutumsaying?

So don't perpetrate, just give it to the Eiht. Called up this bitch, I was already fucking. That made it easier to get her head ducking. Told her we was fixing to have this little get together. She started dragging about the movies, I said hmm whatever. Told her I pick her up about 9:30. I called up this other bitch, ""damn Eiht you dirty"" Pulled up bumping, like flaunting my riches. Ran out about I'd say 8 different bitches. They hung on my window, leaned on my hood, Sat in my seat. Got the raise in my meat. I just had to know if they was skeezing. I ran the line, 'what's the plan for the evening'. Right then, yo, the shit was all plugged. And after the night was over she'd be dug out by a brother who wasn't saying a word. Cause what I needed to say was already heard. Picked the bitch up and went straight to get the liquor. Then right back to my pad, so I could smooth dick her. Told her a drag, it went straight to her head. Cause if I said I just want to fuck my drag would be dead. She downed one cup, then 2 then 3. And Eiht was ready to shake the [huh?] And while I'm in it, I'll ask her can she feel it? Damn, can I kill it? Geah, why'knowutumsaying? Killing it all off.

That's way I exercise my right

How can I ignore the one that loved me, when I could care less
I wasn't fit to live and yet not ready to die, just a mess
You looked beyond my faults and saw my loss
Now portraying joy and zeal is my greatest skill
Now I promise, I will love, praise and keep You in my life

Releasing their death with
Their fingers
My fate lies on a tensel line

Nowhere to hide

In this theater of ill HUMOR
The understudy steals
The stage with an encore performance

This loss of life

And the cries for life that
I'd seem to ignore
The cries for life are now

His pal sat there before him
With a low and drooping head
Listening to the last words
His dying buddy said

Goodbye old pardner hobo
I hate to say goodbye
But I hear my train a comin
& I know shes getting nigh

Gonna tell that old conductor
Just when I'm gonna stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock

We rode the rocks together
We rambled all around
In every kind of weather
We slept out on the ground

Oh pardner don't you miss that train
That always makes a stop
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rock

Would you tell my girl from Danville
That she need not worry a tall
I'm a goin to that country
Where I won't have to work at all

No I wll not have to work there
Or never change my socks
Where the little stream of water
Comes tumblin down the rocks

I'm a goin to that better place
Where everything is right

Wounded in the line of duty, 
Parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties, 
Urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles. 
Leave it all and like a man, 
Come back to nothing special, 
Such as waiting rooms and ticket lines, 
Silver bullet suicides, 
And messianic ocean tides, 
And racial roller-coaster rides 
And other forms of boredom advertised as poetry. 
I know you need your sleep now, 
I know your life's been hard. 
But many men are falling, 
Where you promised to stand guard. 

I never asked but I heard you cast your lot along with the poor. 
But then I overheard your prayer, 
That you be this and nothing more 
Than just some grateful faithful woman's favorite singing millionaire, 
The patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair, 
Working for the Yankee Dollar. 

I know you need your sleep now

Ah, lover come and lie with me, if my lover is who you are, 
And be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more, my child. 
Then let the other selves be wrong, yeah, let them manifest and come 
Till every taste is on the tongue, 
Till love is pierced and love is hung, 
And every kind of freedom done, then oh, 
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love, 
Oh my love, oh my love, oh my love."
clawfinger,recipe for hate,Metal,en,"First of all I make sure I've got the right ingredients
Before I heat up the pan
I take a little bit of bitterness to grease it up
And keep everything close at hand
Then I add a few ounces of fresh frustration and half a cup of attitude
A rush of adrenaline to spice things up
And then half a spoon of bad mood
One bottle of my sweat one bottle of tears,
A few drops of my own blood
It all blends together like a cat and dog
And the result is as clear as mud
I pick the worst situation out of the bunch
And throw it right into the mix
And last but not least I add a little bit of spit,
Just a few little nasty cliques

That's my recipe for hate

I turn up the heat to 400 degrees and go to work on the attitude
I shake it all up in a provocative way to make sure it comes out rude
Then I grind down the frustration hard so that all of the scents can blend
I pour the sweat on top and then the tears
To make sure that I don't make friends
When the mood is wrong, everything is right, I can add the adrenaline
But I've got to be careful with the dose I use,
The effect shouldn't wear to thin
The blood comes last 'cause' it always has a tendency to cool and coagulate
So I calculate and make no mistakes,
It's so fresh that it still pulsates

That's my recipe for hate......

When the meal is done you get a spoiled appetite
And a dish full of disagree some ignorance on the side,
A plate full of hate, served with a fistful of me

away in this land you must go.

From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit.

stan rogers,flying,Folk,en,"It was just like strapping 'em on and starting again,
Coaching these kids to the top, and calling them men.
I was a third round pick in the NHL
And that's three years of living in hell,
And going up flying, and going home dying.

My life was over the boards and playing the game,
And every day checking the papers and finding my name.
My dad would go crazy when the scouts would call;
He'd tell me that I'd have it all
Ninety nine of us trying, only one of us flying.

And every kid over the boards listens for the sound;
The roar of the crowd is their ticket for finally leaving this town
To be just one more hopeful in the Junior A,
Dreaming of that miracle play,
And going up flying, going home dying.

I tell them to think of the play and not of the fame.
If they've got any future at all, it's not in the game.
'Cause they'll be crippled and starting all over again
Selling on commissions and remembering
When they were flying, remembering dying.

And every kid over the boards listens for the sound;
The roar of the crowd is their ticket for finally leaving this town
To be just one more hopeful in the Junior A,
Dreaming of that miracle play,
And going up flying, going home dying."
joni mitchell,coyote,Folk,en,"No regrets Coyote
We just come from such different sets of circumstance
I'm up all night in the studios
And you're up early on your ranch
You'll be brushing out a brood mare's tail
While the sun is ascending
And I'll just be getting home with my reel to reel...
There's no comprehending
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
And the lips you can get
And still feel so alone
And still feel related
Like stations in some relay
You're not a hit and run driver, no, no
Racing away
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
We saw a farmhouse burning down
In the middle of nowhere
In the middle of the night
And we rolled right past that tragedy
Till we turned into some road house lights
Where a local band was playing
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
And the next thing I know
That Coyote's at my door
He pins me in a corner and he won't take ""No!""
He drags me out on the dance floor
And we're dancing close and slow
Now he's got a woman at home
He's got another woman down the hall
He seems to want me anyway
Why'd you have to get so drunk
And lead me on that way
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines of the freeway
I looked a Coyote right in the face
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town
He went running thru the whisker wheat
Chasing some prize down
And a hawk was playing with him
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
He had those same eyes - just like yours
Under your dark glasses
Privately probing the public rooms
And peeking thru keyholes in numbered doors
Where the players lick their wounds
And take their temporary lovers
And their pills and powders to get them thru this passion play
No regrets, Coyote
I just get off up aways
You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
Coyote's in the coffee shop
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
He picks up my scent on his fingers
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
He's too far from the Bay of Fundy
>From Appaloosas and Eagles and tides
And the air conditioned cubicles
And the carbon ribbon rides
Are spelling it out so clear
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Or take off out of here
I tried to run away myself
To run away and wrestle with my ego
And with this flame
You put here in this Eskimo
In this hitcher
In this prisoner
Of the fine white lines
Of the white lines on the free, free way."

Supposed to last a whole lifetime

I keep my mind
Occupied and satisfied
I keep my eyes on the consolation prize

But in the night
I lose the fight
I toss and turn
While my fears unite

My teeth grind every time
The visions come, I wish I was blind
They're teasing me, endlessly
With a dream that was, but can never be

I was never meant to be without you
I was never meant to be without you
I supposed in time, I will get by
But I was never meant to be without you

Well, now it's been
3 weeks since I wrote this song
Now the future's wrong seems way too long
I thank the stars you taught me to be strong

And now I walk the line
Your hand in mine
Your still my guide, side by side
I tell myself it's just a matter of time

And now my life keeps movin' by
And now I hear your voice in mine
I still smile most of the time
At memories, our lives intertwined

You're keeping me company
With a love that was, and will always be

For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night."

I looked into your eyes
They told me plenty
I already knew
You never felt a thing
So soon forgotten all that you do
In more than words I
Tried to tell you
The more I tried I failed

I would not let myself believe
That you might stray
And I would stand by you
No matter what they'd say
I would've thought I'd be with you
Until my dying day
Until my dying day
Plenty, plenty, plenty

I used to think my life
Was often empty
A lonely space within
You hurt me more than
I ever would have imagined
You made my world stand still
And in that stillness
There was a freedom
I never felt before

I would not let myself believe
That you might stray
And I would stand by you
No matter what they'd say
I would've thought I'd be with you
Until my dying day
Until my dying day

Put me in a hole for shelter

There is something in you I despise

So follow, follow the sun,
The direction of the bird,
The direction of love

Breathe, breathe in the air,
Cherish this moment,
Cherish this breath
Tomorrow is a new day for everyone,
Brand new moon, brand new sun

When you feel life coming down on you,
Like a heavy weight
When you feel this crazy society,
Adding to the strain
Take a stroll to the nearest waters
And remember your place
Many moons have risen and fallen long, long before you came

So which way is the wind blowin',
And what does your heart say?

So follow, follow the sun,
And which way the wind blows
When this day is done"

'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you.
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

For real knives
For real cries
And then the flash of steel from real guns
In real life
Really fills my mind

And I really miss what really did exist
When I held your throat so tight
And I miss the bus as it swerved from us
Almost came crashing to its side

Sometimes the blood from real cuts
Feels real nice
When it's really mine
And if you want it to be real
Come over for one night
And we can really, really climb

And those blue bridge lights might really burn most bright
As we watch that dark lake rise
And if you really want to see what really matters most to me
Just take a real short drive

It's just a drive into the dark stretch
Long stretch of night
Will really stretch this shaking mind
And this room, unlit, unheated
And the ceiling striped
And the dark black blinds

I want to know this time if you're really finally mine
I need to know that you're not lying so I want to see you tried
And I don't want to hear you say it shouldn't really be this way
Cause I like this way just fine

Cause there's nothing quite like the blinding light
That curtains cast aside
And no attempt is made to explain away

It was supposed to be
Just a one night

So why am I sittin here

Lookin out for her"

Hear no sound
Time stood still
Enter the void
Leave no trace
Of where you've been
Never thought you'd understand
The years are slipping out of your hand
All we ever wanted to be
Is floating in the emerald sky
Our skeletons remain
Under a Neon Noon
Hands turn to dust
Psychic waves
Fill the air
All what we have
Is what we've done
To what we had
Never thought you'd understand
The years are slipping out of your hand
All we ever wanted to be

Our skeletons remain
Under a Neon Noon
Sink like a stone
Hear no sound
Time stood still

willy porter,flying,Indie,en,"I want to be free to fly like you
I want to be free to walk, to stand, to start anew
Oh, to feel grace within these wings
Oh, to be forgiven for all your memory of sin

Because we waited so long to shine, to shine
This love is so strong I'm flying
I'm high on God's love

Oh, the taste of ruby wine on lips
Oh, to be hypnotized by the lying swaying billboard hips
It is our souls to which the big machines are drawn
And it's money that fuels their hearts
There are no human dreams at all

They want you to drink your drink and lay your money down
When you awaken, you will hear
The sound around you sounding out but I
I feel like you and I are just beginning to shine, to shine, yeah

I pray for peace or at least an open window
I want to be free, I'm free to walk, to stand, to start anew
Oh, the feel of grace within these wings
We have been forgiven for all our memory of sin

Because we waited so long to shine, to shine
Love, it is so strong I'm flying
I'm high on God's

Got a lot of love, a love supreme
Say, you got a lot of love
Got a lot of love, a love supreme
Say, you got a lot of love

Got a lot of love, a love supreme
Say, you got a lot of love
Got a lot of love, a love supreme
Say, you got a lot of love

Got a lot of love, a love supreme

You got a lot of love

tom baxter,the moon and me,Indie,en,"Sometimes when I wake at night,
I lose myself a while.... 
And I pray to the moon despairingly, 
Comfort me, please comfort me
For sometimes, my smile won't smile, 
And my laugh won't laugh
And my heart grows cold and lonely, 

Open like a book, my heart, it reads broken sentences, 
And for pages you turn and the chapters you read, 
It's though my story will never seem to end,
For sometimes my gears won't change and my clutch gets stuck 
And my wheels won't turn on empty 

So if at night you hear a voice, it may be the moon and me, 
Or if at times you lose your light then ask the moon to shine on you!
Join the moon and me
The moon and me... 

And though the world is a cruel cruel place at times
They say a mans not meant to shed a single tear ... 
Oh well if you like me, simply disagree 
Then when the day lays down to sleep, creep beneath the moon with me
For sometimes, my smile won't smile
And my laugh won't laugh
And my heart grows cold and lonely 

So if at night you hear a voice, well it may be the moon and me, 
Or if at times you lose your light then ask the moon to shine on you!
To shine on you... to shine on you....
Join the moon and me!

marianne faithfull,epilogue,Folk,en,"Our revels now our ended,
These are actors, as I foretold you,
Were all spirits, and are melted into air,
Into thin air.
And like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself.
Yea, all which it inherit shall dissolve,
And like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind.
We are such stuff as dreams are made of
And our little life is rounded."

Can't you see their faces read our sin
I'm startin' to get weak in the knee
I'm starting to think they're all after me

Did you hear them whispering our names
Did you hear them say that I'm to blame
My ears are burning as word hits the street
I'm starting to get dizzy from the heat

Shadows of love shadows of love
All we ever do kiss and run
Push comes to shove I want no part of
A love we can't bring into the sun

Listen don't you stand so close to me
Seeing us together's all they need
Our reputation seems to be in doubt
I'm starting to go down for the count

Shadows of love shadows of love...

Feels like they're all breathing down my neck
I feel like I could drown here in my sweat
I sure could use some help from above
Oh all I got are shadows of love

between the buried and me,lay your ghosts to rest,Metal,en,"Under it all
A new world
A new world made with the hands of madness
These hands
They will always do the cutting
Piece by piece the pain gets worse
If only I could see myself right now

The gathering of flesh
Transforming my face into an unrecognizable state
Smooth out the eyes
Smooth out the lips
Every mirror is a past idea smashed upon recognition (These selfish reasons, the letter is all I left for explaining)

Will it be found?
Will the right hands deliver?
The heartache I left

Cut until all that is left is new material
Myself
Day in, day out
Deep down I know what I must do

So much happens behind closed doors
So much happens behind our closed doors
This key will open them
Expose us all

Crusty-eyed symphony
Awakened by my grunts and moans
Why do I do this to myself?
I suppose the choice was all mine
God felt so much better before the mirror glimpse
On the surface I know what I must do

The precaution documents
The fail safe way back ""home"".
Should I end it right here and now?
That would be far too selfish
I shall end what I've begun
The creation of more
More of us
The skin and bones of destruction
An army of weak souls
Weak minds
Weak life

(Written in a language I can understand. My brilliance seems questioned with these instructions. Fairly obvious for precaution documents I suppose. The ""Night Owls"" always send me back. Seems to be in their DNA)

Where the Peabody Hotel meets the velveteen sky

Where hands cross the ivories from six until nine
She sings away sorrow each night when she leaves him
She goes home alone,
She's not the marrying kind

Love is a memory that she'll always hold
Cause love in a memory never grows old
Why she did leave him, well nobody knows
Love in a memory never grows old

Now he works the toll booth on the New Jersey Turnpike
The ring on his finger grows cold to the bone
His sons were all dreamers who cheat on their own wives
He still dreams of St. Paul when he's cheating alone

Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you
Might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Still I say to myself, get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head with a smile
That makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance

Across all the seas, it's fine by me
'cause I'll never be far from home

My heart takes a hit and then my heart hits back
And each day I find comfort in the fact
I listen to my friends when they say
'Man just relax, 'cause it's all a game'

I've found they're right and now I see
I'm gonna have my fun and what will be will be
Now I'm walking up the street, whistling this

Forgotten her old name

Sandbags along the river

Wear your aqua mirabilis
Dotted on your pulse points
A miraculous transformation
Ahh my aching joints

You are a vision in the air
Cheap lipstick, bleached hair

Ohh dressed like that
You are a flag of a dangerous nation
Oh dressed just like that
You are some kind of declaration

Come to me now
You are warming weather

And dance clubs don't exist

And then shift and shift

Almost trusted you with my love
Had to make sense of all your interest

It will only take one thing
This time to realize your state of mind
'Cause I can be used beaten and bruised
To justify your state of mind
But I won't be fooled - this time

I was the seed that grew from your treachery
And I was the taste that opened up the mouth of your mistake

It will only take one thing this time
To realize your state of mind
'Cause I can be used beaten and bruised
To justify your state of mind
But I won't be fooled - this time

From ordinary words and ordinary days
Something impossible came
Made you a liar to feed a desire
To break my heart again

david hazeltine,when you wish upon a star,Jazz,en,"When a star is born
They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do

Fate is kind
She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing
Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
Your dreams come true"

way up high
there's a land that i heard of
once in a lullaby. somewhere over the rainbow
skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream
really do come true. someday i'll wish upon a star
and wake up where the clouds are far
behind me. where troubles melt like lemon drops
away above the chimney tops
that's where you'll find me. somewhere over the rainbow
bluebirds fly. birds fly over the rainbow. why then
oh why can't i?
if happy little bluebirds fly
beyond the rainbow
why
oh why can't i?"
augie march,there is no such place,Indie,en,"There is no such place, 
O yes I have seen it too 
Just a little different from how you do, 
A river winding blue among the dunes 
And a marble bed 
A sun that doesn't set but settles. 
There is no such place. 
If I lower mine to yours 
Would you kiss me on the face? 
If you're looking for an unmarked place, 
There is no such place 

Blasted in appearance and 
A composite of fearful minutes 
Frozen in the waking instant 
Longing, things I long for, 
Peaceful nights, 
Strangers at the door, 
O come in, come in, 
You've been here before. 
There is no such place, 
So perhaps we have a reason 
For our long and falling face, 
Above all it would be warm 
But we would keep our heads all 
Clear as Winter, storms would be 
A sight to make us shiver 
But without the chill 
Of thinking all is hither-thither 

Longing, 
Things I long for, 
Peaceful nights, 
Strangers at the door, 
O come in, come through the door, 
You've been here before, 
You've been here before 
There is no such place, 
O yes I have seen it too 
Just a little different from how you do, 
A house upon a hill with no windows 
Just a can upon the sill 
To catch your tears 
To feed your garden."

kansas,sparks of the tempest,Rock,en,"The sparks of the tempest rage a hundred years on
The voice of the dreamer screams, the cause of the pawn
The King and the Queen are gone, each piece is the same
The difference between us is a part of the game

Darkness is spreading like a spot on the sun
The dead are the living in the age of the gun
While everyone clamors for the justice they seek
The world is corrupted and the strong take the weak

They mold you and shape you, they watch what you do
The sparks of the tempest are burnin' you through
Spreading like wildfire, fallin' like rain
Though they may promise, they only bring pain

The future is managed, and your freedom's a joke
You don't know the difference as you put on the yoke
The less that you know the more you fall into place
A cog in the wheel, there is no soul in your face

Run for the cover, Millennium's here
Bearing the standard of confusion and fear
Spreading like wildfire, fallin' like rain
Though they may promise, they only bring pain

Blood in the sand, a cry in the street
Now the cycle is nearly complete
Ten thousand years, and nothing was learned
No turning back, now the wheel has turned

Big Brother is watching and he likes what he sees
A world for the taking, when he's ready to squeeze
The King and the Queen are gone, each piece is the same
The difference between us is a part of the game

Soothsayer saying now tell me no lies
What is this madness that is filling the skies
Spreading like wildfire, fallin' like rain
Though they may promise, they only bring pain

death angel,word to the wise,Metal,en,"Words are spoken from the book of the dead
Written in the blood of the ones who bled
Foretelling the story of our destiny
Shadow on the fate of humanity

The tyrants of the earth have made their plans
But the future of the world is in our hands
The ending of a war that would never end
Created by the kings of the kingdoms of man

The unification of the human race at last
Brothers and sisters come together forgive the past
Deep in your heart and your soul lies the key
Step through the door to a world where people are free

If hopelessness is what you see it's what you'll get
Believe in today because the fight isn't over yet
Our sons and our daughters will live if we never say die
Shame when the ones who have wings don't use them to fly...

There's hope for the world today I know
Believe that it's not too late for love
There's hope for the world today I know
Believe that it's not too late for love
For love"

There's no in between, not for you
You give him everything that you got
You love him all the way or not
When you love someone it just hurts
When you've done everything to make it work
So when everything's not enough
Maybe he's just not the one

[Chorus:]
Sometimes love walks away
Sometimes love has to change
Sometimes the heart has to break
But you're not the only one
That's been hurt by love
Sometimes love's not the way
That you thought it would be
Sometimes you just got to leave
But you're not the only one
That's been hurt by love
When you love someone it's natural
To have second thoughts, should you go
It's not easy girl, being strong
You keep wondering if you were wrong
But don't you fall for that it's a game
The trying to make you feel you're to blame
To protect your heart there's no shame
You know better girl walk away

richard thompson,did she jump or was she pushed?,Folk,en,"She was there one minute
And then she was gone the next
Lying in a pool of herself
With a twisted neck

Oh, she fell from the roof to the ground
There was glass lying all around
She was broken in a hundred pieces
When her body was found

She used to live life
She used to live life with a vengeance
And the chosen would dance
The chosen would dance in attendance

She crossed a lot of people
Some she called friends
She thought she'd live forever
But forever always ends

Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?

Oh, she used to have style
She used to have style and she used it
And they say it turned bad when
The truth came 'round and she refused it

They found some fingerprints
Right around her throat
They didn't find no killer
And they didn't find no note

Did she jump or was she pushed?
Did she jump or was she pushed?

watching you dance
a bit scared now

with ambitions
breaking my love

Fear has a name
Written on our hallowed ground
With their tears
Those words never saved
To fear your heart and our dreams
Are these beyond our grasp?
Crawl down dead lover's lane
The maze of memories stained
And it sucks the blood right out of my heart
Scream out love's name in vain
Erase the pain again
And move yourself across the dark

To follow a peculiar light

That made them take leave of their land?
And carry gifts on camel back
Of the years of endless sand

Through cloudless days and cloudless nights
The bells upon the camel ring
And the wind played on rips of sand
It must be the voices of angels singing

Gold to crown His loftiness
Myrrh for the man upon his death
Frankincense for godliness

Black smoke eyed that starts tonight
Minds explode in golden sand
Underground black waters flow
In Afghan fields, the poppies grow

He offered me a vision
On the end of a silver spoon

That all were in his powers
If only I would follow him
The universe was ours
Walked a thin white line to the coffin club
Downstairs from the devils den
Had a large double Jesus
Chased down with a shot of Zen
The last thing I remember
Was lying in the tank
And when I came around again
Everything was blank
Floating high above the world
Out on the astral plane
I'm bouncing like a pinball
He's busy being born again
I met God on Primrose Hill
That's where he came to me
He stepped out of his saucer
I got down on my knees
From his lips came just one word
He left me all aglow
I sat down and had a smoke
And watched the flowers grow
The bats are in the belfry
And the bubbles in the bong
The secret of the universe
Is hidden in this song
The Shaman left a crawling
As the dawn broke the gloom
Talking in some other tongue
And laughing like a loon
The early morning sunlight
Splashed colours on the wall
And I don't know if it ever
Really happened at all

And the bubbles in the bong
The molecules inside my head
Are chiming like a gong
The bats are in the belfry

Glad that I left when I did before, I know you, you can't
get the best of me

When I?d speak of spirituality you would label it absurd
When I spoke of possibility you would frown and

It's your fire, it's your soul, you shouldn't have to go. First thing they'll say's take off your shoes, And they'll say they want your story, but they get confused, By all those words you use.

Your fire, your soul, you shouldn't have to go. And they'll say, ""You're family, you belong to us. You can stay at home and have our love and trust, But any day now one of us could die, And if we make you suffer don't you want to find out why, 'Cause we love to watch you try, With your fire, your soul, your soul. It's your fire, it's your fire, it's your fire. Then you'll fly home and get the flu, And you'll keep staring at the ground, you always do, When they get their time with you.

And he swears there will never be another on 
In the dark recess of the mine, where you age before your time 
And the coal dust lies heavy on your lungs

At the age of sixty-four, 
If he lives that long, 
He'll greet you at the door 
And he'll gently lead you by the arm 
In the dark recess of the mine, 
He can take you back in time 
Tell you of the hardships that were there

seth lakeman,the ballad of josie,Folk,en,"It was Monday morning in heavy rain, 
When Josie went from our house, never back again, 
Out beyond the hillside where the cattle stand, 
With her recent lover holding her right hand. 

They both went out together in the Monday mist, 
She never saw it coming, waiting at his wrist, 
He struck her swiftly and she fell right down, 
Flowers grew around her a body never found. 

Whenever you`re walking out in the snow, 
Think of poor Josie all on her own, 
Wherever those flowers stand out unknown, 
Youll be steppin` on her gravestone. 

So tell me where is Josie and where`s she flown, 
You both went out together you`ve come back alone, 
You sit so sadly with a face so cold, 
You`re no more paler though than the life you stole.

Back again
Like its never been
For the first time
It seems to mess with my head
Now when I realize what it takes
Can I relate
To whatever but never will it drive me to hate
Could be the next guy that you take before I wake
Now I lay me down to sleep, eyes tight when I pray
This here is real life, circumstances make you think
Should I be counting my blessings?
The next second my eyes blink
Here in the Southtown, you know that kid don't play
Put it down in the streets, will I see another day
If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine
And thank God that I made it alive
One love, its easier said than done
Can I rise above everything that comes my way?
Like words you say
You let your tongue get loose
But when push comes to shove, not used to walking away
I keep on looking up, cause these times, they getting tough
Tomorrow's gone, and its the same old song
Father fill my cup, give me strength to power up
A life to shine, you're the diamond in this rough
Dont wanna throw up my fist, aint got to be like this
dont wanna throw up my fist i must resist
It aint gots to be (like this)"
life in your way,not a word,Metal,en,"Here we are unfaithful with our words
Choices made that separate life and love leaving empty eyes and
Hands that dare not touch the truth
Honestly dishonest this selfish pursuit buried deep in a discord of faith

While not concerned with their hearts (here we are unfaithful with our words)
Discoveries overlooked entirely
What's in my mind what's written on my heart
What's remembered no more

The old is obsolete and the new will make the old soon disappear
Though I feel wicked we can give good things
May my wealth be found and be worthy of my duty
I call for change to end this life I long only to hold true

To be a witness held by goodness held back by conviction
I truly am blowing in the wind
Without you holding me there would be nothing left to speak of
Even though I feel that I am less than the least can I sing in the shadows of your wings

Where else might I sing but in the shadows of your wings?
Where else might I hide but in the shadows of your wings?
Where else?"

But slowly eats away
Like a man plagued with disease, I try to fight
Through my pores it seems to seep...

You're content with doing nothing
There's nowhere to run and hide
when you're living to die
Stuck alone inside your head,
better off dead
The phone would ring in the empty house,
no one's around.

Then swear that the figures are lying
I'm a much better comic, then mathematician
'Cause I'm better on stage than at intermission

And as far as the man is concerned
If I've been burned, well I haven't learn
I know he's around when the sky and the ground starting ringing
I know that he's near by the thunder I hear in advance

His words and his words alone
Are the words that can start me heart singing
And his is the only music that makes me dance
He'll sleep and he lies in the light of two eyes 
That adore him

Oh bore him it might, but he won't leave me sight
For a glance
In every way every single day
I need less of myself I need more him, more him
And his is the only music that makes dance
Yes his is the only music that makes dance"

The apparition of this land and it's dream
Makes me feel I've seen it before
I can taste there's life

In the desert of my life

Their kingdom will come
And I'm the leading one
Battlefields on our crusade
Filled with Sardokaurs
Killing machines crying
In raising fear they're hiding
Where do we go now?
So where is the way?
When I'm a million miles from home

All pain and sorrow

Makes me feel I've told them before

I'll control destiny
In the desert of my life
I've seen it again and again

By my dreams I must find a way
To stop the raging war
I've to choose now
I will leave
My body and seek
And time will stand still
When I've to leave
My body and find
A way back to the world I love
When I'm a million miles from home

The stolen statues have lost their heads
The great wall of china is melting in the rain
Stacks of words are burning like Pompei

The fog in our bedroom was thicker than before
I called your name and it felt like war
And we ran with our shoes off to the pavement's end
To the place of our birth at the end of the earth

Helpless kiss, I'm rudderless
How do you intend to unbreak this?
We're a paper fleet in an arctic freeze
On the skin of an endless open sea

In boxes in the basement, we buried our hurt
We were keeping score, we were saving our words
We touched like flowers, frozen in wreaths
We fell like stones, we were running in our sleep

Helpless kiss, I'm rudderless
How do you intend to unbreak this?
We're a paper fleet in an arctic freeze
On the skin of an endless open sea

Happy endings are dependent on where the film is cut
Noah's Ark and the Titanic are different scenes of the same plot
I will not tear apart your photo, I will not desecrate your grave
Because I know they are not responsible for the time when they were made

please don't sacrifice your heart if time is why you parted ways
there's things you shouldn't give away
you don't need to be so frantic

to leaving home and loving not
my enemy my mind

there will be a sunny day when i can gather up the words
to say that i am living
say i'm living anyways
so i might as well enjoy it since i have the time to spare
i'm not going anywhere
or at least i like to think i'm not

sarah mclachlan,witness,Folk,en,"Make me a witness
Take me out
Out of darkness
Out of doubt

I won't weigh you down
With good intention
Won't make fire out of clay
Or other inventions

Will we burn in heaven
Like we do down here
Will the change come
While we're waiting

Everyone is waiting

And when we're done
Soul searching
As we carried the weight
And died for the cause
Is misery
Made beautiful
Right before our eyes
Will mercy be revealed
Or blind us where we stand

Will we burn in heaven
Like we do down here
Will the change come while we're waiting
Everyone is waiting

Make me a witness
Take me out
Out of darkness
Out of doubt"
sarah vaughan,my one and only love,Jazz,en,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love."

[Verse 1:]
You supposed to be that nigga,
You got a dime on ya side,

Listen I ain?t bein? reckless

(Look what ya doin? to me),
You got me contemplatin? thinkin? maybe,
I should come check you out in that suite,
Pop open some yellow bottles undress me like a model,
Then maybe we could wrinkle the sheets,

But then I know she?ll always be the one you,
Take out show around,
But you continue to hold on to me so,
(Why ?),
Would you think that I could settle for less it?s just
One night no I,
Don?t wanna wake up the next mornin? askin?,
(Why ?)

[Chorus:]
So what I need to know is,
If you?re foollin?,
Only foollin?,
All I asked is (Why ?),
If you?re foollin?,
Only foollin?,
All I asked is (Why ?)

[Verse 2:]
Now the media?s gossipin? pinnin? me in magazines,
Sayin? I was the one,

Look baby I ain?t the one,
What I?m sayin? is,
I ain?t tryin? to go for that,
(No),
Look I can?t go for that,
(No),
You need find out where your home is at,
And turn the key and range rove it back,

You didn?t want me then so tell me what made,
You changed ya mind
'cause ain?t a thing don?t changed about me,
Tell me (Why ?),
'cause when you say you love me it?s when I?m with
Someone else I can?t help,
You to continue foollin? me,
So tell me (Why ?),

So what I?m tryna? say is

Swear by your throne

Fallen words shall grieve thee

Ember eyes beyond reason shall see

Flee from the safety of the sheltering sky
See all but logic, so vengeance shall be

And ever so suppressed

Which is tickin' me right off 'cause I
Had that cap since I was real-real small.
Then find out just right now
That my main squeeze went through my phone.
0ooooooo...
So I guess I'm single now.
Imagine that!

So I sneak right on The T
The conductor sees me
He's kicking me right off with a frown
I grab my bag and I walk on.
Comm. Ave., I hit up Blanchard's
They sell cheap wine, I got six bucks.
Bag rips, wine smash.
Drink it up avoid the glass!

But I can't help from just smiling
When that damn sun is shinning on
Hell, It's just
Shinning down all over me
No, I can't help but just smile
While that damn sun is shining on
Dang, it's just shining down
Down over me

So now I call up my friend
'Cause his girl must be bored 'cause, see
She's been spreading rumors about me
That I robbed her party, but I never had.
I pull out my little disc man
I bought from a crackhead down in Reno
But my Melt-Banana Cd
Is all scratched up.

I think it's stupid all the people who are moaning
Yeah, moaning on
While the sun is shining down
On our city streets
Even all the things people say
Nah, ain't affecting me
Not when that damn sun 
Is shining down over me.

Shining down on me.

Born to just never care,
Born to just never care,
Born to just never care
About the stupid things
People moan everyday

So later on I meet Johnny Trouble
At a bar called Shay's, a spit from Charlie's
We sit outside talking about girls
How they're loons but we like them anyway.
No money for pints at the bar
We bring a backpack full of Pabst
0ooooooo...
Under the table we fill our glass.

So me and Johnny just sit outside
Warmed by that summer night
While those city stars are shining
Down on our streets
And I just can't help from smiling
While those damn stars are shining down
Yeah those stars are shining
Over our city streets

No, I won't be caught moaning
Not when light is still shining down
And me and Johnny
Warmed by that damn summer heat.
And I can't stop from just smiling
When those damn stars are shining on
Yeah, those stars are shining
Over our city streets.

Imagine that?
"
iron & wine,rabbit will run,Indie,en,"Last I saw mother, she rose from her chair
When they caught me I'd just finished combing my hair
'Cause a rabbit will run, and the colt hasn't long with the mare

We've all learned the earth while we've carried the throne
We dove under the rivers and under our clothes
And I still have a prayer, as sure as my settling bones

Last I saw mother, she covered my ears
When they caught me I offered the captain a beer
'Cause the rabbit will run, and the lion has nothing to fear

We bricked up the garden and know what it means
And we've all kissed a virgin as if she were clean
And I still have a prayer, despite all the colors I've seen

And judgment is just like a cup that we share
I'll jump over the wall and I'll wait for you there
Well past the weeds in our vision of things to come

We've all heard the rooster and all been denied
And we've seen through the haze and the spit in our eyes
And I still have a prayer, a well-weathered word to the wise

Last I saw mother, she smelled like a rose
When they caught me, the captain, he opened my nose
'Cause the rabbit will run, and the wind takes a bird where it blows

We've all traded lovers and woke up alone
And we've clapped for the king though our fingers were cold
And I still have a prayer 'cause I love what I cannot control

Last I saw mother, she acted surprised
When they caught me, the captain, he cried like a child
Because the rabbit will run, good dogs together go wild

We've all lived in grace at the end of the day
And we've armed all the children we thought we betrayed
And I still have a prayer, but too few occasions to pray

And judgment is just like a cup that we share
I'll jump over the wall and I'll wait for you there
Well past the weeds in our vision of things to come

And we've all found a reason for hiding a gun
And we've helped out a few if we've hurt anyone
And I still have a prayer, and so be it, I've done what I've done

Last I saw mother, she blew me a kiss
When they caught me, the cuffs cut the blood from my wrist
'Cause the rabbit will run and the pig has to lay in it's piss

We've all given half to the hand in our face
We've all taken a stone from the holiest place
And I still have a prayer, and I've furthered the world in my wait"

There you were waiting to bring me 'round.

bill jones,goin' back,Indie,en,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember"

As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp,
And in its song there is sadness
Because there's no you,

The lonely autumn trees,
How softly they're sighing,
For summer is dying,
They know that in my heart
There's no gladness
Because there's no you,

The park that we walked in,
The garden we talked in,
How lonely they seem in the fall,
The stormy clouds hover,
And falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall,

In spring we'll meet again,
We'll kiss and recapture
The summertime rapture we knew,
And from that day,
Never more will I say there's no you"

You came to me with nothing to gain
You offered your best

Want to give You everything
Nothing holding back
want to show You just what I mean
Doesn't matter what they say

No, I don't care about that

There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'.
One of us is changin', or maybe we've just stopped tryin'.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you.
You were light and breezy, an' I knew just what to do.
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it.
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide,
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no.
 
There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel it too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and how I once loved you.
 
And it's too late, baby now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it. (we can't make it)

Let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
Worth it when people say
You don't deserve it
Then don't give in
Cause hate may win some battles
But love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun
While the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you

And the condensation collects on my feet
And my lungs contract as the curtain thickens
And I hear you say you'd like to see what's down beneath the violent blue
And as you say those words my legs turn leaden

And your teeth are two white smears that cut the gray
Like light behind the clouds
And my heart is flapping like a bird that's trapped inside a wire cage
I hear you laughing, saying:
""Darlin', there's no need to fear. You know how to swim.""

Well, let's see how well I do

This blue ain't blue
It's velvet black
A crooked mirror sky
And we hum like stars
And flicker off into the blank and void
I feel your limbs; they pull me down
I feel your limbs; they pull me down
And now we're too far gone
And won't ever be found"

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New Orleans"

He's not the one we know and he knows
I slept through the war you waged with him for a little bit
Until he cracked your bones and you had to let go
So I make believe I've discovered peace
But I'll skin the man alive and sell the meat
I'll wait in the dirt where he left your blood
If he returns for it I can make it right for good
Oh how I wish he would
Lost you in the overflowing fog that's been here awhile
So I plan to keep watch as long as the wolves are out
They're always around and more violent than hell
I have eyes of every color now and they're vigilant
It doesn't matter who knocks
You don't let them in

There are terrible men
I'm one so I should know
Heaven smiles on me now and then
But the devil always had hooks in
All I want is his head
And this horrible fucking world will be wonderful again
There is so much beauty and love
And when I eat his beating heart I can bring it back to us
All I want is his head
And this horrible fucking world will be wonderful again
There is so much beauty and love

The engine echoes in the night
Through a concrete jungle a wasteland i call home
No fears and no regrets
No apologies for the things I've said

From this hell I will survive
It's all I've done, it's who I am
Just know this
I've done the best I can

I see fallen angels and broken dreams
I'm still surviving on these streets
Like forgotten soldiers left here to die
All your pain I understand
Give me your love, you take my hand
And from this wasteland we will ride

We will ride on through the night

Within the distant clouds I see a friend of mine
And then as the shadows disappear
He smiles at me
And I know
He's watching
He lives within the heaven
And he lives within my mind
All I can feel is the love he left behind
Then he will whisper in my ear
He tells me, I should know he's watching
And now I'm grown
I'm strengthened by the tears I've never shown
I'm strengthened by the years I've never known
Once afraid of facing them alone
And every day I always have some place to go

the paper chase,i did a terrible thing,Indie,en,"I did a terrible thing
When I monkey-wrenched your circuitry.
And when they finally got to me,
I had built a monster worse than me,
And far worse than you.

And I have become such an ungrateful man -
Just to steal those words you whispered out,
And I snickered in between.
The check point, the boot hill, the ass in me
Says some things still best left unsheathed,
Or out come the knives.

So, retire to your ant hill,
Or cover tire tracks,
And learn to choke it back.
And when they get to you, they'll see
I did a terrible thing,
With a sober mind.

Make no mistake;
I just couldn't stop the hand.
But when you're happy and you're safe,
You'll do anything to keep it that way.

So, do you need the baseball bat,
Or do you need something elite?
Do you need that to feel safe?
Do you need that to feel safe?

(for example)
Last night I took my sharpest blade,
And I cut my tent another five inch slit
To make sure I get away.

And when our weary heads
Hit our sleeping bags,
The brutal honesty
Can tend to spill out, and me
I like to whisk you all away -
Whisk you all away
With my terrible mind.

And when they finally get past
All of your once tightly seriesed,
The check, the point, the charlies.

And when we finally
And when they finally get past
All of your once tightly seriesed,
The check, the point, the charlies.

And when we finally
Get past their doors,
We can hate these sinners
The way we hurt our fathers.

augie march,addle brains,Indie,en,"A Tuesday night in Winter, holed up in the city of ravens, 
The owls in the hills hoo-hooing and eyeing off the field mice down in the cold grey centre, 
Addle Brains lining up with the dead for the soup spoon, 
Addle Brains and the legions of the passed for the bread bag, 
Ladle the soup, pass the rolls, 
Addle Brains and the many not here and loose souls. 

One might fly off to the blank heavens and the lead high halls, 
O the hungry sky aches for blokes without folks and bulges with the bearers of palls.

And sleep in the glens of botanical parks, and on the humped bus shelter seats, 
Where it's cold, where it's cold.

And couldn't think for the life of me what I was doing, or where to start, 
Or what rehearsal was required, I was so sad and tired. 

What does a bird want with money? 
Was he made this way? 
Do you have to earn the right to find all of this funny? 
Nothing's funny today. 

Addle Brains mixes his powders with his fateful blues, 
And the wide-eyed bubs of the Parliament couldn't give a hoot, or even two. 
All it takes, it takes, is a kind look and a word, a word, 
Some pretty eyes and skin, from your fine family you were given to win, 
And spill it over into the basin of common sin, 
Just a drop, a drop of the stuff that makes us kin 
- Addle Brains perching way out on a limb."
the autumn offering,decay,Metal,en,"Just one more high
This life is all I know
Hide in myself
I'm condemned by myself

I'll decay before my time
Choking upon this guilty deed of mine
Home on the floor, you can hit me once more
Will power is dead and gone

Confined
This guilty deed of mine
My life, I'll decay before my time
Confined

Just sit back and watch it all
I can't be what you want from me
Regret has set
And sank its teeth in me

Into the skin, not knowing when I will win
Bruised body is all I hold
It's not my choice, I have no grip on this
Blinded by light, always losing my fight
Just crumble and lose it all

Confined
This guilty deed of mine
My life, I'll decay before my time
Confined

Always waiting for my lucky day
Over and over every patch of gray
One day inside me I was lucky anyway

In this fortress

And sometimes celebrations 
Lose their charm

Susan do you mind, 
Sometimes I'm restless
Rolling on the floor in pain and woe
After all the precious gifts you
Will gladly give to me, girl
I may blindly lock and bolt the door

Baby, sweet baby
I'll truly love you through my years
Well it's just that sometimes 
By midnight light
I'm frightened by my fears
But if you could just hold me, 
Warm me, girl
The way you did today
And tenderly anoint my eyes
Then I may see the way
Susan, baby, take me to that party
'Way over yonder

Tell me, Susan, do you mind
Come on, Susan, take the time
Tell me, Susan, do you mind
If I've been blind a long time?
I been blind a long time

Sometimes, see, if you're
Not careful
A little hurt, pain in your heart
Will make you blind
Blind to the real thing, once
It comes along
Honey, can you wait, baby
Can you wait for me, till I 
Get this thing together?
I been blind, I been blin, 
Blind a long time
Sweet Susan, take the time, girl

If I say I love you, baby
Tell me, Susan, mama,
Do you mind?

That you and your father could share
Football coach said you're too small
Don't even think of basketball
You knew you were destined to fail
Went to the track meet

Get back in your seat they said
Go to the dugout
Three strikes you stuck out (sore loser)
And home runs flew over your head
Looking down on rock n' roll
And you dreamed of scoring goals
You're saving those dreams for your bed
Thought it was cool to be a jock
You ended up a rent-a-cop
A dozen donuts in your hand
You're a loser
A sore loser
Now it seems the tables turned
The game of life you should have learned
So try using some of your brains
All your high school friends are stars
Driving really fancy cars
The irony drives you insane."

Tender fits with tenderness, uncouth to tell the truth

The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous
The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun who violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce
Mama's in the fact'ry

Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for the fuse
I'm in the streets
With the tombstone blues
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then she sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""
Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

Looks up to his hero the Commander-in-Chief
""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""
Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saving, ""The sun is not yellow it is chicken""

An' I pray my fears ain't showin' thru

Insecure - if I could feel I really had you for sure
I wouldn't be so insecure
I sit an' wonder what to do
Waitin' for my big time interview
As my palms start to sweat
'Bout this job I'm tryin' to get
Someone says ""Hey, Jett, it's time for you""
(I bet they're right now)
Insecure - everybody feels a little
Insecure - tell ya one thing I know for sure
We're all a little insecure
You shouldn't care what people think of you
All you can do is be yourself
No matter how they see you
You really can't be somethin' else
You're not the only one that feels this way
Inside they look the same as you
When it seems never ending
Remember they're pretendin' too
Insecure - natural to feel a little
Insecure - everybody gets it an' there ain't no cure

Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

""Let not your heart be troubled,"" His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,

Watch her faking her power
Smiling as she would

Denying what I've done
I destroyed myself but I wish you well
Completely overthrown

Across the bridge at midnight
Heads turning as the lights flashing out

And walk right out to the four line track
There's a camera rolling on her back
On her back

All the way down her spine

In miles of sharp blue water coming in

And she wonders how she ever got here 
As she goes under again

staircases take me high
escalators take me high
ladders take me high
elevators take me high
staircases take me high
escalators take me high
ladders take me high
elevators take me high
started at the surface so my goal is up
cause once you stay down then you gon' get stuck
and i'm just trying to climb and grind
the same time
dangling off rooftops is what i call our hangtime
walking through the hall
counting my flaws
my ego got caught in a elevator wall
got it out
raised it to the rooftop
damn
got to take the ladder cause the escalators jammed
made it to the top but i ain't even stopping
i said a prayer and a wish and turned my skateboard to a rocket
i'm gone
to the skies
i'm nothing more than another rebel
but i'm still trying to take it to another level
get up out the ghetto
maybe hop up on the shuttle
jello with a piece of metal
my foot on the pedal
people say the world could fit into a little pebble
then give me one good reason why you think we should settle
staircases take me high
escalators take me high
ladders take me high
elevators take me high
staircases take me high
escalators take me high
ladders take me high
elevators take me high
look inside my eyes
you can see the universe fly
deep inside my pupils the aliens camouflaged
another way to shoot you
my mind is of mass destruction
i'll drop a gallon of henny in the big dipper then dive
bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
ever seen a martian? gorgeous or some u.f.o. porsches
i live inside the air plus i wear air jordans
so the mic is always near me whether swaggin' or recordin'
journey on my voyage
you know the sky is the limit
but it's ironic that method never applied to kendrick
i catapult over your telescope and when i'm finished
i grab the fire that's burning from mars to light an incense
this rapping's just a metaphor and i deserve a medal for
writing another metaphor
about ambition
i envision me taking off astronautin' myself
fuck the world
i'll beat that bitch with the orion's belt
staircases take me high
escalators take me high
ladders take me high
elevators take me high
staircases take me high
escalators take me high
ladders take me high
elevators take me high
as i'm floating all alone
i looked up and i start thinking
in a moment i'll be gone
getting high so i'm not sinking
as i'm floating all alone
i looked up and i start thinking
in a moment i'll be gone
getting high so i'm not sinking
getting high so i'm not sinking
staircases take me high

Where went the beauty of our youth?

But I know you're a woman
We are as young as the night""
I said ""No telephones ringing
No company coming
Just the lap of the lake and the firelight""
And the lonely loon and the crescent moon
What a pocket of heavenly grace
But in France they say
Everyday
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces
About a month or so later he said
""Why can't you be happy
You make me feel helpless when you get this way""
I said ""I'm up to my neck in alligators
Jaws gnashing at me
Each one trying to pull a piece away""
Darling, you can't slay these beasts of prey
Some bad dreams even love can't erase
But in France they say
Everyday
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces
He said ""I wish you were with me here
The leaves are electric
They burn on the river bank
Countless heatless flames&quot
I said ""Send me some pictures then
And I'll paint pyrotechnic
Explosions of your autumn till we meet again
I miss your touch and your lips so much
I long for our next embrace""

Everyday

Gotta let go

And think about the life I've had
So much to change but I can't go back
What happened to that kid
He used to play in the street
I think about that kid
He looked just like me
Had a smile, had a home, never grow old
When we grow up, do we have to grow cold
Spent his whole life looking for salvation
Never realized nobody could save him
So all these words
For what they're worth
I know it's hard
I know it hurts
And we laugh at the past
Cause it's how we learn
Welcome to the world now let's watch it burn
I just wanna life that seems
A little better than a dream
But I just can't seem
To get on my feet
So I gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
I'll hope someday that you will know
You gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
I hope someday you'll understand
Sometimes it's hidden
Wish that I could see
A future picture of an older me
Would he be smiling and would he be happy?
Would he say a thousands words while looking right at me?
Is he different, or the same old me?
Is he still chasing after these same old dreams?
I know that I'll never reach perfection
At least he could point me in the right direction
Some grow old, and some grow cold
They'd sell their souls for a heart of gold
God only knows where the hell would I be
If I had the old me sitting beside me
I just wanna life that seems
A little better than a dream
But I just can't seem
To get on my feet
So I gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
I'll hope someday that you will know
You gotta let go
Gotta let go
Gotta let go
I hope someday you'll understand

No one knows what it's like to be alone
Please tell me is anyone out there?

No one knows what it's like to be alone
Please tell me is anyone out there?

Newspaper blowin' through the grass
Falls on the round toes
Of the high shoes
Of the old friends

Lost in their overcoats
Waiting for the sunset
The sounds of the city sifting through trees
Settle like dust
On the shoulders of the old friends

Can you imagine us years from today
Sharing a park bench quietly?
How terribly strange to be seventy

Old friends
Memory brushes the same years
Silently sharing the same fear
A time it was
It was a time
A time of innocence
A time of confidences

Long ago it must be
I have a photograph
Preserve your memories
They're all that's left you"

Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk Off everything my pen wrote we went from bundy to winslow This for shorty up on glen grove who love when I catch my tempo I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna The fresh prince just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie All these 90's fantasies on my mind The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time I might come through without security to check if you're fine That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO Wanted to tell you, ""accept yourself"" You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help You know, back on your feet and shit Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though? Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorcese And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro? As hell below, I'll see you when you get there Are you enjoying yourself? If we may we'd just like to close off with something a bit inspirational Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all Are having the same fears, shedding similar tears And of course dying in so many years It don't mean that we can't have a good life So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought"

billy bragg,the boy done good,Folk,en,"Strange as it may seem, I once had my football dreams
But I was always the last one, the last to get chosen
When my classmates picked their teams
I guess that was the way it stayed in every game I played
Life just tripped me and clattered and kicked me
Till you picked me from the parade
Now I feel like I've won the cup every time that we
Make love
Forty-five minutes each way, at halftime I hear a brass
Band play
The boy done good, the girl done better
The seasons turn and we're still together
The sky is still blue and tomorrow is another day
You weren't that kind of a girl who likes her studs to
Be covered in mud
Taking you to the pictures was a regular fixture
For one of life's eternal subs
I tried hard acting tough, but I just can't stand the
Taste of that stuff
Like some macho park player I got in the way of
In some grudge match against his club
But I'm happier how I am today now I've put my
Boots away
I guess I'll never get picked to play my song on match
Of the day"
patti labelle,when you love somebody (i'm saving my love for you),R&B,en,"My love waits for you
There's nothing I can do
So I'm holding back
Afraid when I can't save it all
This love I know

I'm saving it, you've got to keep
I'm saving it, your love to me
A sentimental love tonight to me
Every time it is when you love somebody

No tears, no signs
Only makes it so much harder to go on
Just take good care
And remember when you're feeling all alone

You'll be with me in my heart
And always on my mind
The only thing that keeps us apart is time

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together
I'm saving my love for you

When we're, our two
And I felt that I've known you for so long
One thing, I knew
It was lovin' that would last on and on

Even with the best of plans
The world gets in the way
Don't be downhearted
I'll soon be back to stay

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together

And I would be a fool to throw away my chances
The best shot that I ever had

And all that we could have
One of those romances
That's warmer with the good times
And grows stronger with the bad

Ooh Lord, I'm saving it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together
Oh, I'm saving it

Ooh baby, I'm saving it
Yes, that's all I wanna do, just save it
All I wanna do, sweet thing, is save it

Saving it, ooh baby, boy, I'm saving it
Only thing I want to do is save it
Sweet, sweet baby, I'm saving it
Saving my love"

simon joyner,parachute,Indie,en,"I think that smile is shutting down 
Or maybe it's just flinching 
The sun shot up just like a child 
But these old hands are only inching 
Would you believe it is my fault 
I went and made myself lonely 
I miss the way she said my name 
Like I was a distant city 

Winter came and swept away 
The birds nest from my chimney 
The cold air marched right through the walls 
And settled her in my belly 
But her memory keeps me tossing 
Those letters into the fire 
And the flames they're twitching 
A love which has retired 

Now New York is not a place I'd choose 
To have my body buried 
But Omaha has got the trains to take 
The snow to the cemetery 
There is a place called home I believe 
If you're willing to step out of the loop 
I miss the way she held on to me 
Like I was a parachute"

holly williams,waiting on june,Folk,en,"She was from North Louisiana in the town of Mer Rouge
I fell in love in a week or two,
It didn't take long to love a girl like that
We were barely ten in the cotton fields
Playing horseshoe with the coloured kids
I tried to kiss her, she grabbed a baseball bat

I was waiting on June, I hope she comes to see me
Waiting on June, I can't take this feeling
Waiting on June, I pray to God she'll love me one of these days
I hope I find my way waiting on June

I went off in '42 to fight those boys and pay my dues
Her wallet picture kept my spirits high
Charley boy died in my arms, he saw Jesus, I saw blood
It soaked her wallet picture that cold night

Well I told my best friend Charley I would kiss his girl goodbye
He made me promise I'd go home and make miss June my wife
Shaking like a drunk old fool, I hopped off of that plane
And I ran home to ask her in the rain

Waiting on June, I hope that she says yes
Waiting on June, in her faded summer dress
Waiting on June, her daddy shook my hand
And she lit up the moment I pulled out that silver band
Waiting on June

Well we married at the Methodist Church
Found a big white cow and a piece of dirt
With pecan trees to build our homestead on
Jolynn, Becky, then Donna, then Shelby,
Our tiny house was a sanctuary
Laughter filled those rooms all day long

Waiting on June, she's putting on her makeup
Waiting on June, she's trying to get her hair curled
Waiting on June, kids listen to me
You walk on down to Sunday school, I'll be there in 15
Waiting on June

Well time flew by like they said it would
Yeah the kids grew fast and the farm did good
Mrs. Bertha made our supper everyday
At noon that silver bell would ring
We'd all say grace and dig on in
We always ate together in those days

One by one those kids went off and found a love of their own
There's nothing like the joy I knew when they brought their babies home
We'd play all day in the cotton fields with the dogs I raised up right
And end in grandma's kitchen every night

Waiting on June, honey don't burn the bacon
Waiting on June, our bellies are a-aching
Waiting on June, she turns that fork so slow
And we all had to sit there 'til the last bite was no more
Waiting on June

We were slower than we used to be, the nursing home told June and me
That we'd have separate rooms side by side,
Oh what I'd give for one more night of sleeping with my wife,
Since '45 I've touched her skin in the middle of the night
So I'm lyin' in this single bed until they cut the lights,
That's when she'll sneak in and I'll be fine

Waiting on June, so we can kiss goodnight
Waiting on June, I'll hold her hand so tight
Waiting on June, I'll love her 'til I die
It's bittersweet when love grows old and you really miss your wife
Waiting on June

Well they buried me last Tuesday morn,
The good Lord came, He took me home,
I closed my eyes and quickly went away
But the angels let me see her everyday

Waiting on June, our mansion is so grand
Waiting on June, footprints in the sand
Waiting on June, that's the story of my life
Cause me and Jesus are standing here 'til she walks through that light
Waiting on June

I'm still waiting on June,
I'm always waiting on June.
No more waiting on June"

I'll say to you
On this planet of dirt
Number one comes first

This is our place
The last of the human race
Children of disgrace
Now can you all hear me say

There's a calm before the storm
Don't say that you ain't been warned
A calm before the storm
And it's coming for you

Is there life after death
Do you ask yourself

This is our place
The last of the human race
Children of disgrace
Now can you all hear me say

There's a calm before the storm
Don't say that you ain't been warned
A calm before the storm
And it's coming for you

I have smelled the fear
Heard the screams of pain

This is our place
The last of the human race
Children of disgrace
Now can you all hear me say

There's a calm before the storm
Don't say that you ain't been warned
A calm before the storm
And it's coming for you

There's a calm before the storm

leonard cohen,avalanche,Folk,en,"Well I stepped into an avalanche,
It covered up my soul;
When I am not this hunchback that you see,
I sleep beneath the golden hill.
You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn, learn to serve me well.

You strike my side by accident
As you go down for your gold.
The cripple here that you clothe and feed
Is neither starved nor cold;
He does not ask for your company,
Not at the centre, the centre of the world.

When I am on a pedestal,
You did not raise me there.
Your laws do not compel me
To kneel grotesque and bare.
I myself am the pedestal
For this ugly hump at which you stare.

You who wish to conquer pain,
You must learn what makes me kind;
The crumbs of love that you offer me,
They're the crumbs I've left behind.
Your pain is no credential here,
It's just the shadow, shadow of my wound.

I have begun to long for you,
I who have no greed
I have begun to ask for you,
I who have no need.
You say you've gone away from me,
But I can feel you when you breathe.

Do not dress in those rags for me,
I know you are not poor
You don't love me quite so fiercely now
When you know that you are not sure,
It is your turn, beloved,
It is your flesh that I wear."

Are you thirsty? You wanna wet your throat before we go
Let's creep to the bar take a shotta XO
Maybe it'll help us loosen up
Guaranteed to get us right

We can two step to the door
I think I found what I came here for
I don't wanna wait a minute more
We've wasted half the night

When you walked by with those thick thighs
So captivating, oh, so motivating
Go on and take my hand, show me that you're comfortable
Let me give you what you need

dee dee bridgewater,a  foggy day,Jazz,en,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Everywhere
Everywhere
Everywhere"

A child's dream of death
Torment, I'll Forgotten

Guidance, it means nothing
In a world of brutal time
Electric, circus, wild
Deep in the infants mind

Silent scream
Bury the unwanted child
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn

Shattered, ado encent
Bearer of no name
Restrained, insane games
Suffer the children condemned
Scattered, remnants of life
Murder a time to die
Pain, sufferage toyed
Life's little fragment destroyed

Silent scream
Bury the unwanted child
Beaten and torn
Sanctify lives of scorn

Life preordained
Humanity maintained
Extraction terminated
Pains agonizing stain
Embryonic death
Embedded in your brain
Suffocation, strangulation
Death is fucking you insane

A child's dream of death
Torment, I'll forgotten
A soul that will never rest
Innocence with drawn in fear
Fires burning can you hear
Cries in the night"

A lasting impression can fuel this move
And love will always over come

What I do is wrong and I keep moving on

So, with your heart stops, or your hands tied
Be the rainfall, cause a landslide
And if they come to sin, then something's wrong with them
I been off, now I'm on again
I just wanna live while the feelings live, a hundred on the highway
Put the top down, feel the air, kill the snare

We're the star, don't bother us, no time for the lectures
Many memories, I wouldn't trade for the planet

And I'm with you but I'm just not there
And I'm drifting through the sea
Evening closes in
And I don't know if its sink or swin
And I think about what might have been
But its just a memory

I wanted to hold you
There at the old hotel
When I'm not with you
I'm just an empty shell

Telephones will ring
And I guess I miss the simple things
In the winter waking up to spring
And you tell me you're alone
I was scared to fail
I was following a breadcrumb trail
And its pushing me beyond the pale
And I'm ready to go home

Accidents happen
Sometimes it feels like fate
Something between us 
Suddenly radiates

And in my secret heart
A revolution starts
The sun is burning through the clouds
Meet me on Sunday night
Wait for the northern lights
Everything is temporary now.

And the morning light comes crashing through
And you sing your resurrection blues 
And you harmonize with skeletons
But the melody is clear and true
And this used to be a children's game
And I don't know when but something changed
And I couldnt tell you what it was
But I know it doesn't feel the same."

I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade

Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go ‘cause he don't know

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

Fight to the death and I don't know who wins

How can I be both

Reached the conclusion some things never change
Like love can be tough and I don't feel my age
But life is a moving ocean of colour
And I choose what I know
To be true

Pull it apart and put it back together how you want it
Often it's not the same as it first seemed
While nothing can last forever
Everything has its shape
And usually it's exactly what you need

Bliss is surrounding twenty thousand people
What will it take to break the magic spell?
Who saw the mercy, who heard the whistle
Of a bullet as they fell?

Pull it apart and put it back together how you want it
Often it's not the same as it first seemed
While nothing can last forever
Everything has its shape
And usually it's exactly what you need

When I fall
Fall like a stone
Dropped in a river
Too heavy for the flow
But it's now or never
I'll build myself a heaven
Making a heaven
And this is how you do it
You pull it apart and put it back together
Pull it apart and put it back together
Pull it apart and put it back together

We're making sweet love 

We're making sweet love babe 

It's sweeter then morning dew 

You know I'm so into you 

There's no other touch 

And it hurts me so much 



[Chorus] 



[Mase] 

Come on come on 

Come on come on, come on come on 

What you think hun, Ma$e be young, Ma$e be dumb 

Get Ma$e strung, there'll be no pre-numb? 

But ever since B.I.G. died, my life's changed 

Got the blue, I'm your boo, that's quite strange 

I get nice thangs, way out the price range 

And half these girls, don't even know my right name 

See a fly rollie, mink made of coyote 

Love a ghetto chick, I know she died for me 

You got me confussed, see Cam the freak 

Ma$e never the playa, bring sand to the beach 

I'm sumthin' that the average girl hand couldn't reach 

Living expenses, 20 grand a week 

You know me, I be O-T, low key 

Platnuim rollie, smokin' a O-Z 

I'm that babyfaced playa, without no goatee 

2 point 8, and about to go 3

Spinning would change and things are rearranged

Up the revolution we're all prepared to die
Up the revolution that was the battle cry
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay

in the good old days of way back when
The cigarette was cool
and all the kids in school could read and count to ten
Annie once said he had a few to bribe
of that there was no doubt
He never could make us understand
what the rebellion was all about
Up the revolution we're all prepared to die
Up the revolution that was the battle cry
There's gonna be Hell -yeah- Hell to pay
There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay
Two-tone Annie drew up battle plans
for making love not war
Everybody laughed at the fighting in the streets
and behind the garden door
It came to nothing when it all went down
and the band began to play
Another plan put your head
in the sand live to fight another day
Up the revolution we're all prepared to die
Up the revolution that was the battle cry

There's gonna be Hell, Hell to pay

My dreams have withered and died
Once I was bending the tops of the trees
Kind words in my ear, kind faces to see
Then I struck up with a boy from the west
Played run and hide, played run and hide
Count one to ten and he’s gone with the rest
My dreams have withered and died
Silver moon sail up and silver moon shine
On the waters so wide, waters so wide
Steal from the bed of some good friend of mine
My dreams are withered and died
If I was a butterfly, live for a day
I could be free, just blowing away

Teased me and lied, teased me and lied

bruce springsteen,the man who got away,Rock,en,"Last night I went to the Coronado
I bought my ticket and I found my seat
It was a new adventure straight from Hollywood
Lights went down as I felt the heat
They went tearing from the final scene
Burning rubber, spilling gasoline
As the credits rolled away
They were still chasing the man who got away
Well, every night for weeks and weeks now
I beat the traffic, I beat the heat now
For two hours I can believe now
The man who got away was me
I went tearing from the final scene
Burning rubber, spilling gasoline
As the credits rolled away
They were still chasing the man who got away
Drove into Stockton, my radio went dead
That's when I heard what the newsman said
Said, ""armed robbery on the ten-hundred block
Was two men involved and one man shot
Well, while his accomplice made the payday
With a 45 he blew the cashier away way
Last seen headed on the State Highway
Driving a late model Chevrolet
I went screaming from the final scene
In a hail of bullets and flaming gasoline
As the credits rolled away
They were still chasing the man who got away
Man that got away
Man that got away

And then I walked her home
From our postmortem date
She took me by the hand and we danced upon her grave

While some Hitler claims to speak for the Son of Man

Stir up the fire watch it grow

Everything forgotten in holy wars

There's a nightmare coming - Born Again, born again blind

With sex in one hand and a gun in the other, Christ returns
The right-wing respectable clampdown clan
Find their figure head in a holy man
Here come the Christians an hysterical mob
Worshipping the Devil in the name of God."

But now I got my freedom,

Hope that someday you'll come home

Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind
Shy girl, so humble
With eyes that make me stumble
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything
I go out, you eat in
Hot from the situation
You're naked in daylight
Wrap yourself up and goodnight
I'm burning, I'm hungry
Angry 'cause she don't love me
You got me completely
In my own game you beat me

Hope that someday you'll come home

These groups and singers think that they appeal to everyone By singing about love because apparently everyone has or can love Or so they would have you believe anyway But these groups seem to go along with what, the belief That love is deep in everyone's personality. I don't think we're saying there's anything wrong with love, We just don't think that what goes on between two people Should be shrouded with mystery. Love'll get you like a case of anthrax And that's something I don't want to catch Love'll get you like a case of anthrax And that's something I don't want to catch"

the tallest man on earth,wind and walls,Folk,en,"Well I was willing orders while I thought you heard 'em say
So you drifted off to see what's not in yourself

Light is turning slowly will it lay out on the plains
No more nights to watch you roll back in
No relief of no rain

You're still singing songs of rivers
Like through accidents within
And telling people lies of
Lions, treasures and kings

Nothing's more revealing than the dancer and the doubt
Waving to forget what's never gone
Always there, never rise

And all these riots are broken sounds
Like the last voice you heard
And you drown, oh no

You know this is wind and walls
And weathered leaves and terraces
The minnows in your pockets win the
Rabbits on trails

This is not the future but I sense it's up right up there, oh
Just another hour, another pass
Another day anywhere

And all these riots are broken sounds
Yeah, you sleep on the track
Every night, oh no

And we don't know if your treasure is safe
Or where you'll be when they find you some

And you know they're always following me
So when I get there you trust me some, sweet

I'll catch 'em

This is where you're passionate of seasons and their strength
And this is where you'll breath and walk and know they will end

The light is turning slowly through the hand up on your chest
So lay it on the plains where there is ?
There is love, there is rest

From all these riots of broken sounds
Where you sleep on the track
Every night, oh no

And we don't know if your treasure is safe
Or where you'll be when they find you some
And you know you're always following me

I'll be the best when the silence comes"
tommy dorsey,san francisco,Jazz,en,"It only takes a tiny corner of 
This great big world to make a place you love
My home up on the hill
I find I love you still
I've been away but now I'm back to tell you

San Francisco 
Open your golden gate
You let no stranger wait outside your door
San Francisco
Here is your wandering one 
Saying I'll wander no more
Other places only make me love you best
Tell me you're the heart of all the golden west

San Francisco
Welcome me home again
I'm coming home
To go roaming no more

dark age,seven,Metal,en,"Ernest Hemingway once wrote: ""The world is a fine place and worth figthing
for."" - ""I agree with the second part...""

I try to be a modern, god- following honesty
I try to be a modern god that lives in dignity

But there is still this aching thorn
Moral mistakes that are inborn
I know them all somehow...

Ohh, what a feeling that I am dealing
I know your seven sins need seven allies
Ohh, what a feeling that I am dealing
I know your seven gods need seven more lies

Lies... seven lies

I cannot be a modern god living on bleeding knees
I cannot be, a modern god without divine release
My soul feels so unreal and torn
Human mistakes that are inborn
I know them all somehow...

I know the ruleless rule gods and others
Your heaven knows not what I have been through

A virtue for ages, they began to close the circle
declaring doubt to be a sin
I never wanted what I never needed

Pointing your weakness to confirm my beliefs
Beginning to see that sinning is a part that makes us human"

A calm sea voiced with a lie
I could only smile, I've been alone some time

And you, you had hope for me now
I danced all around it somehow
Be fair to me, I may drift a while
Were it up to me, you know I'd

I, I called through the air that night
The faults were swarming inside
Was it infantile, that which we desired?
Were it up to me, all from your eyes

And I, I called through the air that night
My thoughts were still blurry inside
We were closer then, I've been alone some time
Filled you glass with gin
Filled your heart with pride
And you, you had hope for me now
I danced all around it somehow
Be fair to me, I may drift a while

If there's a plan for me
Would that make you smile?
No, don't want to be there for no one
I can't be saved"

Now that we've gone our separate ways I still recall those brighter days The days that didn't seem so very long Neither of us are to blame we overly know that it's a shame That all that we had going now is gone We had all of the good things...

jonah jones,rose room,Jazz,en,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

It's paying better than the grave
When we talk without amend, we see red, and then
Deep inside the blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage"
richard thompson,if love whispers your name,Folk,en,"Next time I promise
I will be ready
Ready to move when the clouds roll apart
Next time I promise
I will do better
When the sun shines on me and pierces my heart

If love whispers your name
Breathes in your ear
Sighs in the rain
Love is worth every fall
Even to beg
Even to crawl

I won't act so cool
I Won't be the fool
Next time
And I won't quote the law
Won't be so sure
Next time

'Cause I once had it all and
I once lost it all and
I won't miss again
If the chance should come my way 
If love should look my way 

If love whispers your name
Breathes in your ear
Sighs in the rain
Love is worth every fall
Even to beg
Even to crawl

I won't act so cool
I Won't be the fool
Next time
And I won't quote the law
Won't be so sure

'Cause I once had it all and
I once lost it all and
I won't miss again
If the chance should come my way 
If love should look my way 

If love whispers your name
Breathes in your ear
Sighs in the rain
Love is worth every fall
Even to beg
Even to crawl

Love is worth every wound
Each lonely day,
Each sleepless night
Love is worth every wound
The price that you pay
To live in the light"

After the way you broke my heart

I want you only, 'cause no one else will do

The day we quarreled and you left me
Before you walked out through the door
I wanted to tell you how much I would miss you
But my pride wouldn't let me tell you so

It may sound silly but if you phone me
And ask forgiveness for doin' me wrong

Oh yes it may sound silly but if you phone me

the statler brothers,song of david,Rock,en,"David, son of Jesse
Shepherd to his fathers sheep
Played the harp when Saul got weary
Rocked the giant till he was fast asleep

People prayed when Saul killed thousands
When David killed ten thousand they cheered
And all that noise they saw angry
And the shepherd was on the lamb for years

David was a man down in Israel
Fighter, lover, shepherd, king, outlaw
And through it all God loved him and forgave him
David the man who'd done it all

Bathsheba wife of Uriah
Took a bath under David's watchful eye
He fell in love and took her body
Then he sent Uriah out to die

He was weak like you and I are
And as a sinner David did his part
But God said this man David
Is a man after my own heart

David was a man down in Israel
Fighter, lover, shepherd, king, outlaw
And through it all God loved him and forgave him
David the man who'd done it all
Ah David the man who'd done it all"

You’re such a sight to see in the month of June
Beautiful like the moon’s reflection when
It’s passing off your skin
And before you let me in
I hear you say
It’s been a long time
I say OK K K don’t worry I got you
Do ya say
How bout some foreplay
Got that, got plenty, I got you
Do ya say
Play some slow ones
Got that Sade, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye too

Lay back relax, Girl I’ma be
Light as a feather but hard as a rock
Cause daddy know just what you like
Gonna love you gently
Light as feather but hard as a rock
Verse 2
See I know just when to finish
And I know just when to start
And I’ll be lovin your reaction
Every time I hit that spot
Gently
Bottom soft like leather
Gently
But the top is hard
Gently
Whisper your pleasures
Gently
Then I’ll do my job
Invigorating, intense
Girl let me do what I do
I don’t know what’s echoing louder
The music or you
Gently
I ain’t close to be done yet
Gently
But your getting real warm
Gently
Like the calm of the thunder
Gently
Right after the storm
You say, you say, do you say it girl
Make it
Gonna push it to the limit
It's yours, It's yours
See second place or win the race
I’m gonna be your number one
Til the sun shines
Here comes the sun
Forever more
Let’s try and taste the moon again forever more

A fact's a fact
From Nome to Rome, boy

Play your cards, show us what you got
What you're holding

She favors the bold, that's cold
Stop throwing stones

So get out there and rock
And roll the bones

Rollin' down the Rocky Mountains?
Movin' like the wind that sweeps the Kansas plains
I know you're with me as I make my way through Oklahoma
Pass the barns and weather vanes
There are motels, cafes, fields and billboard signs
A thousand miles of highway between your heart and mine

There will finally come a moment
When one man and one woman
Get everything that they've been waiting for
I'll take you in my arms again
Feel your skin against my skin
Let the sheet fall slowly to the floor
'Til nothing comes between us anymore

In my soul I can feel you
As I cross the Mississippi
You're the river flowin' in me
Comin' home, I count each heartbeat
Till the moment we're together
And the distance can't be measured
That's all that keeps me goin' when I'm gone

There will finally come a moment
When one man and one woman
Get everything that they've been waiting for

Empty hands
Wishing my wrists were bleeding
To stop the pain from the beatings
There you stood
Holding me
Waiting for me to notice you

You are the truth (you are the truth)
Outscreaming these lies
You are the truth (you are the truth)
Saving my life
The warmth of your embrace
Melts my frostbitten spirit
You speak the truth and I hear it
The words are I love you
And I have to believe in you

pete seeger,waist deep in the big muddy,Folk,en,"It was back in nineteen forty-two,
I was a member of a good platoon.
We were on maneuvers in-a Louisiana,
One night by the light of the moon.
The captain told us to ford a river,
That's how it all begun.
We were -- knee deep in the Big Muddy,
But the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, ""Sir, are you sure,
This is the best way back to the base?""
""Sergeant, go on! I forded this river
'Bout a mile above this place.
It'll be a little soggy but just keep slogging.
We'll soon be on dry ground.""
We were, waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, ""Sir, with all this equipment
No man will be able to swim.""
""Sergeant, don't be a Nervous Nellie,""
The Captain said to him.
""All we need is a little determination;
Men, follow me, I'll lead on.""
We were, neck deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

All at once, the moon clouded over,
We heard a gurgling cry.
A few seconds later, the captain's helmet
Was all that floated by.
The Sergeant said, ""Turn around men!
I'm in charge from now on.""
And we just made it out of the Big Muddy
With the captain dead and gone.

We stripped and dived and found his body
Stuck in the old quicksand.
I guess he didn't know that the water was deeper
Than the place he'd once before been.
Another stream had joined the Big Muddy
'Bout a half mile from where we'd gone.
We were lucky to escape from the Big Muddy
When the big fool said to push on.

Well, I'm not going to point any moral,
I'll leave that for yourself
Maybe you're still walking, you're still talking
You'd like to keep your health.
But every time I read the papers
That old feeling comes on;
We're, waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.

Waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.
Waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.
Waist deep! Neck deep! Soon even a
Tall man'll be over his head, we're
Waist deep in the Big Muddy!
And the big fool says to push on!"
madeleine peyroux,born to lose,Jazz,en,"Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.

Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.

Born to lose, my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face that empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I'm losing you.

There's no use to dream of happiness
All I see is only loneliness
All my life I've always been so blue

and there are friends around you now. All the days of your life in a line. 
All the way it seemed by 89

But it's not all right. It's not even close to all right.

Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)

We lie awake at night in a tent and I say, 
Tell me about your uncle and his friend 
because they seem like very bad men. 
Well we oughtta keep away from them. 
Bend in the road back there, we saw the place to go. 
Tell me 'bout the greatest show or the greatest movie you know 
or the greatest song that you taped from off the radio. 
Play it again and again it cuts off at the ending though. 
Tell me I'm always gonna be your best friend. 
Now you said it one time, why don't you say it again? 
All the way down the line to where the telephone ends 
come on and shout it on down the wire.

And it's not all right. 
It's not even close to all right.

Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)

And as the rescue party, the volunteer team ah, 
they're just kids of eighteen, and it's the worst thing 
they've seen they're standing all around that tree, 
and I'm so sorry that I can't stop crying.

(Oh, I know.)

Shivering from the late fall cold, 
I felt like a solid ghost. 
I ran and then I couldn't slow. 
My father found me though, my father took me home. 
He said, Oh, son, I saw you get knocked down, 
and I ran out I bet your head was spinning. 
With that bright pain you stunned, 
when you've only just begun to be only just beginning. 
Tossed in the viper pit, all those feelings and fears, 
and all that difficult shit in all those tender years. 
There was something in the air; something gathered in the air. 
Something singing in the wind.

I'll be your fighter and you'll be my mirror. 
And you'll be all right because I'll be right here. 
Oh kid, now I'm not going anywhere. 
I swear I'll try to not be going anywhere.

Though it's not all right. It is so far from all right. 
We'll make it into a choice somehow. 
I don't know, but you'll have a choice somehow.

Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
We can never go back; we can only remember
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)

Maybe they told you 'bout the summer sky, 
maybe they said there's a great gold spirit in the summer sky 
or all your friends (all your best, best friends) 
are gonna gather around your bed at night. 
Well that'll make it all right because it is still so far from all right. Oh, kid, I know.

Down a hall in your house, down a road in December
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Up the stairs four flights, son; can you feel my heart shiver?
(Down, down, down the deep river, down, down, down the deep river)
Wakin' in the dawn with that dream getting dimmer and dimmer.

I said, Are we going down the deep river? Down the deep river? 
Why don't you say you still see it, say you remember? Are we going down? 
Are we going down the deep river? Because I know it's scary, baby."

Take a little peep under that frock tonight
But there be no body pop pop tonight
You know my style I keep it on a holy outa body mind blown

Spinnin' in a whirlpool, ecential peek
Messin' around with all those chemical rushes 
When natural highs come a whole lot cheeper

Cause you got perticulars, I got perticulars
Old circles are sick of us 
Cause we're walkin' down a prim-rose row 
To everything and nothing
So can you picture past the honeymoon
where you beat me with a wooden spoon
And you got me sleepin' on the couch
Now I'm thinkin' who's house is this?
This is my money, this is my pain, these are my drugs
This is my brain, and its never gonna be the same

We professional we dealin' with bussiness 
Revolution creap up slap you on the nose bridge
Touces in the back room gettin' the dutch
And these women in my black book they all quite posh
Still I wash my own breif wash my own socks
Some cocks y'all the horny bastards gressy polls
Square peg in a round hole too much show now
Some say I'm arrogent some say I'm laid back

Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

Last Saturday evening
Came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river
Where you were to meet me

On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read ""Dear Love, I've done you wrong,
Now I must set you free""

No longer can I live
With this hurt and this sin
I just couldn't tell you
That guy was just a friend

Moody River, more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

I looked into the muddy waters
And what did I see
I saw a lonely, lonely face
Just looking back at me

Tears in his eyes
Ang a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love
At his finger tips

Moody River, more deadly
Than the vainest knife
Moody River, your muddy water
Took my baby's life

faithless,why go,Electronic,en,"Stay a while 
Stay a while 
Down in the shadows of your deepest secrets
I sleep next to the precepts you hold most dear
Your heart is in my province jour upon hour
I shiver when you feel the cold, 
Everything you say I hear
Like a bomb and its fuse, 
We bring bright light
But I could be a devil to you
I could bite like a tarantula
Right through the skin
And leave my poison dripping(dream) 
Deliciously Unsuspecting
Protecting you from all harm
Except perhaps from reasoning (these arms)
That hold you

I didn't know you'd be here, and I wasn't meant to come.
I'd be sitting watching TV if there was anything decent on.
If I made some coffee, would you sit and talk some more?
I know words are usually pointless, when you used them all before.
The way you smile fills the room 
Stay awhile. Kick off your shoes. Don't go. Please stay. 
It always happened this way.
Why go? When you can stay awhile,
when you could stay with me, tonight.
Why go? When you can stay awhile,
when you could stay with me, tonight.
Don't go..

I didn't know you'd be here, and I wasn't meant to come.
if I'd missed the taxi or found nothing good to wear.
But for some uncertain reason, some strange and uncertain reason,
this is how it all, it all began.
The way you smile fills the room 
Stay awhile. What's there to lose? 
The way you laugh, when I say, Don't go. Please stay.

Why go? When you can stay awhile,
when you could stay with me, tonight.
Why go? When you can stay awhile,

Why go? When you can stay awhile,

"harry connick, jr.",much love,Jazz,en,"Next to the highway - a noisy place.
Will anyone ever want me?
Tiny place next to the highway.
Could anyone ever want me?
I don't have a car;
My job pays poor.
So much love in my heart.
Looks as if I may have lost my allure,
But I've got much love in my heart.

My appetite for love's voracious.
Will anyone entertain me?
It's no wonder my bed seems spacious.
Could anyone entertain me?
Is it possible
For two of us
To have much love in our hearts?
How it would be
Fortuitous
To find that much love in a heart?

The heat of winter's chill on my face.
Burning that's deep in my chest.
It's cold and familiar in second place,
Knowing I've done my best.

The certain cause for my ambition,
To dress an unyielding sadness.
Flirting with an absent addition,
To simmer away my madness.
The curb that I climb
Is much too steep
To carry that heavy a heart.
I'll stay where I stand
And just try to keep
Love in that heavy a heart.

Away from the highway - a quiet place.
Will I ever find my true love?
Majestic and far from the highway.
Could I have had my last love?
I ride in a plane,
My job pays high.
Still so much love in my heart.
At least I'll be sure of my place in the sky,
With all this love in my heart."

right square in her eyes

because i need some love around to make me whole
but something is funny
cos things i swore i'd never do
i find myself falling a victim to losin' total control
oh yea
cos recently
i ran into
someone that reminds me of you
and even though i know that kind of thing ain't right
i'm finding myself caught up in lies
tryin' to swim against the tide
and as the stage gets set for drama
i can't stop thinkin' about my momma
oooooo
i'm a cheatin' man
and i'll do all i can
to get a lady's love
and i wanna do right
and i don't wanna hurt nobody
if i slip well then i'm sorry

okkervil river,stay young,Indie,en,"Young, stay young
Stay strong, don't get on with it
Gone, way gone with it
It's all done with it
You're all done

All my friends are running to live
On corners
Hurters and the haters and the faders
And the mourners

The world goes to its work and it heads not gentle
And what it breaks you down into
All my friends are looking in life
And it's a lone, lone, lone, lonely child
I said that when you met I was just tired
I said it to know, I said it in silence

Young, stay young
And face y'all now, our time to quit
Strong, stay strong
Mind blowing that y'all drum sick

All these hateful people judging and hand bringing
Lord, why don't you bury me in all they call sinning?
Open up your heart, show me the place where love is missing
How long have you been missing love?
I said all creation posing and diving up between them
Now you have to live it up because my head is spinning

I try, try hard
To talk with you
And talk your god
Of love, of trust
Just me and your love

And I call to all my friends
All the cracked could set a thriller
All the hand inside a tiller
And a hundred job a biller
Settled by the stone
I was rejected by the builder
There was drinking out the thought
They carried from the bloody building
Never let it be said that it wasn't really
The shit I know you're missing, girl
Then I'll pass the edges of the earth and make it wider
I see you're crying
Don't you know it's killing me?

I climb, climb up, way up
To see the sun
One, one job
One life, one love
Is all we got

Young, stay young
Get tough
Get hard with this
Young, stay young
Heart racing, sky raining
Young, I said let it come
Let it come
Stay young
Stay young"

sr-71,go away,Pop,en,"Once inside the door I check my face in the mirror,
As I look past this lonely minute
Was this the ride worth waiting for
I'm scared to death that now I've missed it
But she was not the only stone, skipped across this gravel road
Leading down the path of loneliness
So I'll fly from this hate, pray my soul the lord will take me
To a place through time and indifference

I want to know how do you feel
I want to know if this was real
Then tell me what would you say
If you can make this pain go away

She plans her future looking bright ahead
Leaves me in the past.
I can't stand to hang out with my codependent friends
My patience fading fast
But every sign and every song is telling me I don't belong,
But it's O.K. to feel scared
Cause one day soon I'll find myself and realize that no one else
Will make me feel stupid!

There's this old man down in Fell's Point,
Always hanging around
Telling me, ""Son, the pendulum swings both ways
But for you, It'll always swing down!"""

I stayed with you `cause I really believed
That I couldn't make it
I Want Out!
Ooh baby, got a hold on me

I've got a pair of feet
That found a low down beat
Low down, down around a spot that's hot!

I've got no peace
I'm losin' my lease on livin'
Here's the how?
I'm tellin' you now to give in!

Oh, make 'em play that crazy thing again
I've gotta do that lazy swing again.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.

I got my feet to misbehavin' now,
I got a soul that's not for savin' now.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.

That dancin' demon has my feet in a trance,
'cause while I'm dreamin'
I go into that dance

And once you hear the haunting strain to it,
I'd like to bet you'll go insane to it.
Heigh, ho, doin' the new low down.

Let me strip you of your labels
Then I wanna lay you down
Said I dress you
To undress you

She's so original, no father to her style
I'ma put in the work and be the father to her smile tho
So photogenic when she flash them pearly whites
I do it for the money, man, she do it for the lights (Lights, lights, lights)
Chrome on the heel, Audemars on the wrist
Yea that's my Audemars but she keep me on time
Got a 9 can't be late reservation to the Ritz
I'm in my Louis cape on my Andre Leon grind, that's Vogue, homie
Straight out the pages of the mag
She won't remove them heels man she wear 'em tho it hurts
She tryna see Chanel double CC's on the bag
I'm tryna see what's under that Herve Leger skirt
And so I pull it up, she says she's comin' down
She ridin' shotty in my 72 Ferrari Dino, yea she's my Bonnie
She got that fashion on her mind
Pretend it's February, let me be your Valentino
(I dress you to undress you)

'Cause I only dress you to undress you (Take them clothes off)
Girl, I only dress you to undress you (Take them clothes off)
I just wanna strip all your labels from you (Take them clothes off)
Cause girl, I only dress you to undress you

It's time for chapter two, we headed to Milan
We in that charter plane she got nothin' but panties on
Another glass of chardonnay, now that should do the trick
Damn, look at my life such a Helmut Newton flick!
A picture perfect print, Balenciaga jeans
Multi-colored bills switch it up from countin' green
Man, I'm such a fiend, this is psychedelic loot
I'm countin' 20 stacks in this Pignatelli suit
My 'Diamond Girl' she loves the way the precious stones adorn
And accessorize the fashionable clothes that's worn
And when she moves she's an aphrodisiac
And I complete the circle 'cause I'm everything she lacks
And when it starts to rain, that's the time I'm goin' in
I take her zig-zaggin' underneath Missoni throws
She's soaking wet, I rip the fabric from her skin
And let it fall, 'cause after all it's only clothes
(I dress you to undress you)

'Cause I only dress you to undress you (Take them clothes off)
Girl, I only dress you to undress you (Take them clothes off)
I just wanna strip all your labels from you (Take them clothes off)
'Cause girl, I only dress you to undress you

And as she applies the red to her lip
What's she do it for? She do it for the lights (Lights, lights, lights)
She got that new Hermes bag on her hip
What's she do it for? She do it for the lights (Lights, lights, lights)
In that Tom Ford dress as she's dancin'
What's she do it for? She do it for the lights (Lights, lights, lights)
What you talkin' for? You don't even really stand a chance, man
What's she do it for? She do it for the lights (Lights, lights, lights)

'Cause I only dress you to undress you 
Girl, I only dress you to undress you 
I just wanna strip all your labels from you

talking perfectly loud

So, don't worry because
Santa will find you wherever you are
Santa will find you tonight

If you're listening for reindeer and sleigh bells
As they jingle and tap on the roof
You're awake, piled in blankets
With your cousin Sacramone
And you hope there'll be presents for you

'Cause you're there and you're shining
Bright like a beacon, bright as a northern star
So, don't worry because
Santa will find you wherever you are
Santa will find you tonight

Never let distance keep you apart
With the spirit of Christmas
You'll never be lost
If you truly believe in your heart

When you're there and you're shining
Bright like a beacon, bright as a northern star
So, don't worry because

Why can this never end

Just why would you find
Someone who isn't there
Someone who isn't there

I have no heart that's sounding
I have no blood that's pounding

My feelings remain

I'll see when the end comes
I'll sleep while your time runs

emanuel,dislocated,R&B,en,"I watched the cars collide. 
It shattered glass and stopped time.
Stealing my sight. Blinding my eyes.
Our bodies disconnect. 
Struggle you are trapped there.
Gasping for air. 
Abused.
These hearts are lead and sinking down.
Under the ground.
Tonight, we are all in.
Let go. This is the end.
Tonight we are all in. 
Tell me you're there.
Brighter than aircraft lights cutting into the night.
Climbing so high. In the blank sky.
We waited our whole lives, for this moment to burn.
Our immolation.
Consumed.
Smoke signals to a greater cause.
The message was lost.
Dislocated watching myself die."

Rap: Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit, they try to show us the light but we don't like to hear it, mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics, a large heard across my sight I had to fight to clear it, like a runner a couple of summers I often wondered if it really was winter and that's when I heard the thunder, a current was occurin it was stirrin up my hunger, but I couldn't let the shit burry a nigga under, use to cry hopin all of this would pass, and then I learned to use my tears to water up the grass, a part of my swagga but apparently I won, I took my shades off and now I'm starin at the sun, I'm seein the light, I'm seein the light, realizing that it's me in the light, I read about it (read about it), heard about it (heard about it) now I know I coulda did wrong, I seen a lot of people hustle, but I left them things alone, I almost lost my friend to the struggle, but I guess that made me strong, made me strong, I seen a whole lot of drama, and it taught me how to fight, taught me how to fight, and I thank God for my mama, she showed me what was right, I coulda been in the dark, but thank God for the light, (I see the light) I see the light End adlibs: all the things I heard about, I read about it ,I read about it, oh, I see the light, I see the light"

With a cigarette hangin' out of your mouth and Henry Miller in your 
Back pocket

If the mother goes to bed with you 
In the bowels of the cathedral 
Will you render her asunder with what she really needs 
Or will you crash that beautiful silence with some talk about 
Finding yourself in your mother's arms 
Will you call her a freak 
Will you call them freaks 
Or will you call the gods 
Will you call them freaks 
You know your sperm is weak 
You never looked, so high 
To ever find her, so low 
You did not have to go, that far 
To show her that you were holy 
Now you know they're gonna come for you 
And drag your silly name into the mud 
If the mother bears your children without tears 
And the usual cost of labor"

It's now twenty-five years later, he's on the edge of a park bench He asked God for hope and found his source non-existant He sits in the shadows, because the sun burns no more Now he knows what mom was crying for (Now he knows what mom was crying for) I used to watch old man in the park The sights slowly drove fright through my heart Wishing I could help but not knowing where to start I'd walk away, curse the world, gush some love and curse some more Now you know who I've been crying for (Now you know who I've been crying for) He threw his medals in the river but they sunk alone Put shades on his eyes to hide it from the warzone in the sky He tried to slit his wrists about a month ago But he's seen so much death, he's scared to life of suicide If there was only some way he could escape this penitentiary Goals get bigger and figures it'll chase away his memory But the dreams only worsen, the scenes almost burst in He recalls how training took away his right to be a person Put a gun in his hand, left him to die for the land The plan was the murder of man (The plan was the murder of man) Politicians have a dispute to decide to send in troops But the truth is they just don't understand (They just don't understand) Now he's running out of time, and running out of energy But 'til the last day he will fight for the murder of his memories And although he never got rid of his dog-tags He still wishes they'd have sent his parents an American flag (Chorus) Sometimes gunfire is brighter than the sunshine And sometimes a child's scream influences every dream Sometimes we fool ourselves into thinking we've moved on But no way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen No way, nohow, do we ever forget what we've seen"

Loved ones crying walk away
Corpse unknowingly left behind
Other needs for sick human prey

Casket closed as mourners read
Pages from their holy book
Waiting in a meat locker
Morticians meal hangs from a hook

Storing dead carcasses to dine upon
Chewing on rotten arms and legs
Brutal desecration of the dead
Hacking bodies until he's fed

Service for a vacant coffin
Corpse is being digested
Chronic hunger for cold flesh
Remains of the dead are molested"

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!"

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me"

Pain all over
Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased
Should you or anyone you know
Enough to say they feel as we
Then let our universal song be free
Let our love shine throughout the world
To every mountain tap and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
Til love's all over

Let it reach out to every heart
To every disinfranchised people
Till it is present and no more is
Pain all over

Say words of love to all we see
To rich or poor for love is equal
Let us lift up humanity
Spead love all over
Let all its forces join as one
So to rebuke all signs of evil
Through every valley, land and sea

Our love's all people

george shearing,night flight,Jazz,en,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low

faithless,dirty ol man,Electronic,en,"He's a dirty old man, And a dirty old man, He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine.
I'm a dirty old man The mean streets are home, My life is cold, I'll chill you to the bone,
Heart of stone, Have a care, I carry traces of death in my hair,
You know my breath stinks, I leave shit everywhere,
So be aware I'm unfeeling Don't you dare try appealing to my better nature,
You better wait, you're missinformed, Ain't nothing warm about me,
Cold and gray, concrete clay and steel, And what else is real? I mean the actual deal,
People seem to love living under my hair, Some of them call me London,
I'm also known as New York. Anywhere in the world you find me I talk the same bad talk,
Walk the same walk from side to side, You're transparent to me,
There ain't a thing you can hide, Derive glamour from the stamina it takes to survive.
You think I didn't know it's over with your face like a rat
Now give me your cash and go Before you're heart brakes,
You're living under my wing And all you got I'm gonna take, I'm a dirty old man.
He's a dirty old man and a dirty old man,
He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine.
He's a dirty old man and a dirty old man,
He's a dirty old man and a friend of mine.
I'm a rough old man beyond heart ache, To improve my mood I could use an earthquake,
I sit awake for my people to release the pain, So I can know peace again In my skin,
sin diceit and mistrust soaked in, I think I might just fuss Often drops of woe,
streets flow with tears, I fall down all around your ears.
If I could, if I was made of wood start a fire, no lie,
I can afford to smoke sacred fire, 'cause I wouldn't bet on people changing just yet
My eyes are wet and my heart is full of fear and regret,
So you're catching

Swallow the fears of empty promised hearts
And remember we only just got to the stars
Save the dying arms of midnight
For the patience or lapse of light

Well I don't mind if we're blessed or cursed
And it's our time in the universe
Yours and mine
Breathing beneath the miles of earth and sky
And in sunlight I will appear before your eyes
So don't worry on what tomorrow holds for you
I'll be waiting at the end of every road you choose
Save the dying arms of midnight
'Cause it's our time in the universe
Well I don't mind if we're blessed or cursed
Well it's our time in the universe

Don't matter the end
See it unfold no matter the needs
See it fold up whatever happens to be

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love"

Most of the bad bitches your ex

Tattoos, Suu-Whoop, Bugatti, Nobu
New subject, new paper, new Class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs
Smash later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move
Two eyes to view, but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you?
Two middle fingers that's up high to whom
It may consume, kaboom, goddamn
Who knew that I am the guru with voodoo
That sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron man
and see through the con man
And now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan
Go over to diagram and get to the job man
Watch for the spycam
Sit back and watch and do not watch your watch hand
Give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man
I'm gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No we did not land on Plymouth Rock
But it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans
Than a fuckin' rock band under a rock, man
We need Barack, man
I do what I can to keep it solid
as a you know what I'm sayin'
With some rock playin'

For the art of this shit, Andy Warhol and shit
Go retarded and shit, you go sweet tangy

Walk it like you talk it, now you walkin' in shit

In the spotlight too long should be darker than this
This is Tha Carter, lil' bitch

I thought of this shit, they thought it was it
I'm doggin' this shit, they bark and they sit
Put a fork in that shit, which straw to look in
I brought in this shit, the starters get benched
The artists get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile, I sell myself short if I grin
I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit
In the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit
'Bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit

In the light it moves, red and green are brown
All the time it takes for a night to pass
And a lifetime grows as the day comes down

On the windup world of the nervous tick
In a very fashionable hovel

This battle with the bottle is nothing so novel
So in this almost empty gin palace
Through a two-way looking glass
You see your Alice
You know she has no sins
For all your jealousy
In a sense she still smiles very sweetly
Charged with insults and flattery
Her body moves with malice
Do you have to be so cruel to be callous
And now you find you fit this identikit completely
You say you have no secrets
And then leave discreetly
I might make it California's fault
Be locked in Geneva's deepest vault
Just like the canals of Mars and the great barrier reef
I come to you beyond belief
My hands were clammy and cunning
She's been suitably stunning
But I know there's not a hope in Hades

It's up to me, I'm on my own.
The message of life is turning
Facing the storm.
Life is filled with your memory.
You were deep within my heart.
You were deep with inside of me.
With all this pain that I'm wrapped around.
If there's a heaven up above,
I see the angels falling down
I've got to rise above my life.
To find the reason I'm alive.
I'll save myself, I'm all alone.
I've opened my heart to see there's nobody home.
It's up to me, I'm on my own.
The message of life is turning facing the storm"

It sucks 'cause they play some of my favorite songs like ""Stab My Heart Because I Love You"" and ""Rip Apart My Soul"" and of course, ""Stabby Rip Stab Stab"". And it doesn't help that I couldn't get my hair to do that flippy thing. Like that guy from that band can do. Some days, you know... I'm an emo kid, non-conforming as can be You'd be non-conforming too if you looked just like me I have paint on my nails and make-up on my face I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs 'Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag I call it freedom of expression, most just call me a fag 'Cause our dudes look like chicks, and our chicks look like dykes 'Cause emo is one step below transvestite! Stop my breathing and slit my throat I must be emo I don't jump around when I go to shows I must be emo I'm dark, and sensitive with low self-esteem The way I dress makes every day feel like Halloween I have no real problems but I like to make believe I stole my sister's mascara now, I'm grounded for a week. Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing Girls keep breaking up with me, it's never any fun. They say they already have a pussy, they don't need another one Stop my breathing and slit my throat I must be emo I don't jump around when I go to shows I must be emo Dye in my hair and polish on my toes I must be emo I play guitar and write suicide notes I must be emo My life is just a black abyss, you know, it's so dark. And it's suffocating me. Grabbing ahold of me and tightening its grip, tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans... which look great on me by the way. When I get depressed I cut my wrists in every direction Hearing songs about getting dumped give me an erection I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses I told my friends I bleed black and cry during classes I'm just a bad, cheap imitation of goth, You can read me ""Catcher in the Rye"", and watch me jack off. I wear skin tight clothes while hating my life If I said I like girls, I'd only be half right! I look like I'm dead and dress like a homo I must be emo Screw XBox, I play old school Nintendo I must be emo I like to whine and hit my parentals I must be emo Me and my friends all look like clones I must be Eee-Mo My parents just don't get me, you know. They think I'm gay just because they saw me kiss a guy. Well, a couple guys. But I mean, it's the 2000s. Can't 2 ... or 4 dudes make-out with each other without being gay? I mean, chicks dig that kind of thing anyways. I don't know diary, sometimes I think you're the only one that gets me, you're my best friend... I feel like tacos."

I just need to send them away
Long as the tears of sorrow
I promise will keep them safe
So sorry it didn't work out
You believe the liar in me
My god, my love, my life
My world, my lust, my rage

Agnostic, for the greater good
Where the good things seem to be
Few and far between
Conscious, loss of conscience
Pack the body on ice
Just to keep it numb
Now feel it
Blames a thing of the past
Threw away everything that I had
But robbing, for the last time
Stepping under my skin
(Cast in armor)

[Chorus]
The hate in me
Feeling so empty
The guilt I swallow
Grab the line
Skin the face
Step through me
I leave you hollow

Hollow!

Suffering, of the many dead
Running through anarchy
Running gate, the powers loathe
Helps a thing of the past
Hold the gun to your head
(The hammer falls)

[Chorus]

We're all dead, and we're lost the feeling
So dead, my heart, my life
As they threw it, lost in an instant
Soaring, in my eyes

[Chorus]

I'm pissed
Children

My god, my love, my life
My world, my lust, my grave"

gene krupa,he's funny that way,Jazz,en,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way."
