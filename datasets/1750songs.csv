0,As,"[Verse 1]
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

[Verse 2]
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
Cause I'll be loving you always

[Refrain]
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
(Did you know that you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

[Bridge]
We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

[Refrain]
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4 (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream-Um (Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8 times 8 times 8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you",Stevie Wonder,Soul
1,Superstition,"[Verse 1]
Very superstitious
Writing's on the wall
Very superstitious
Ladder's about to fall
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 2]
Very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me
Sad is my song

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 3]
Very superstitious
Nothing more to say
Very superstitious
The devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
Good things in your past

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
No, no, no",Stevie Wonder,Soul
2,Isn’t She Lovely?,"[Verse 1]
Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love?

[Verse 2]
Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love?

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 3]
Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love

[Instrumental Outro]",Stevie Wonder,Soul
3,I Just Called to Say I Love You,"[Verse 1]
No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 2]
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Outro]
Of my heart
Of my heart",Stevie Wonder,Soul
4,Sir Duke,"[Verse 1]
Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

[Chorus]
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people

[Verse 2]
Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

[Chorus]
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people

[Breakdown]

[Chorus]
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
I can feel it all, all, all-all-all over people

[Outro]
Can't you feel it all over?
Come on, let's feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
Everybody, all over people",Stevie Wonder,Soul
5,I Wish,"[Verse 1]
Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine, ooh
Greeted at the back door
With, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside""
Trying your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whooping your behind

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

[Verse 2]
Brother says he's telling
About you playing doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smoking cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall
(You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing isn't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

[Chorus]
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?",Stevie Wonder,Soul

7,Living for the City,"[Verse 1]
A boy is born in hard time Mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city

[Verse 2]
His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city (yeah)

[Verse 3]
His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city (um-hum)

[Verse 4]
Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Because where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city

[Bridge]
(Living just enough for the city)
Living for the city, yeah
(Believing just enough for the city)
Ain't nothing but a city

Live for the city, yeah yeah

(Believing just enough for the city)
Live for the city
(Believing just enough for the city)
Ain't nothing but a city, woo

Everybody clap their hands together now, woo
(Believing just enough for the city)
Hmm, for the city yeah

For the city, yeah yeah

For the city, yeah

[Spoken Interlude]
Bus for New York City!
Hey, bus driver! I'm getting on that, hold it
Thanks a lot
Wow, New York, just like I pictured it
Skyscrapers and everything
Hey hey brother, hey come here slick
Hey you look, you look hip man
Hey you wanna make yourself five bucks man
You look hip
Run this across the street for me right quick
Okay, run this across the street for me
What? Huh? I didn't know! What?
Gimme your hands up you punk!
I'm just going across the street
Put that leg up, shut your mouth
Hell no, what did I do?
Okay, turn around, turn around
Put your hands behind your back, let's go, let's go
A jury of your peers having found you guilty, ten years
What?
Come on, come on, get in that cell nigga
God, lord

[Verse 5]
His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried and fought but to him there's no solution
Living just enough, just enough for the city

[Verse 6]
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel nowhere could be much colder
If we don't change, the world will soon be over
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city",Stevie Wonder,Soul
8,Higher Ground,"[Verse 1]
People keep on learning
Soldiers keep on warring
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long

[Verse 2]
Powers keep on lying
While your people keep on dying
World keep on turning
'Cause it won't be too long

[Chorus]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
'Til I reach my highest ground

[Verse 3]
Teachers keep on teaching
Preachers keep on preaching
World keep on turning

He's the only friend you'll have around
'Cause the rest of the world will bring you down",Stevie Wonder,Soul
9,Happy Birthday,"[Verse 1]
You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

[Chorus]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

[Verse 2]
I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King

[Chorus]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

[Bridge]
Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world

[Verse 3]
The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out, don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

[Chorus]
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

[Bridge 2]
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Ooh yeah
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday...

[Outro]
We know the key to unity of all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago
That lives in all of the hearts of people
That believe in unity
We'll make the dream become a reality
I know we will
Because our hearts tell us so

Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday",Stevie Wonder,Soul
10,Master Blaster (Jammin’),"[Verse 1]
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 2]
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
You would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin' jam on

[Verse 3]
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Because we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

[Chorus]
You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Na, na na...
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Nobody told you Oh, Oh, Oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it because you never thought that you would be jammin'
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, Oh, Oh, You may as well believe what you are feeling
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Because you feel your body jammin'
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Oh, Oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')",Stevie Wonder,Soul
11,Ribbon in the Sky,"[Verse 1]
Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon's in the sky for our love
If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

[Chorus]
Do...Do
Do Do Do Do Do
HMM HMM

[Verse 2]
This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love
We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
A ribbon in the sky for our love

13,Faith,"[Verse 1]
See the girl with the diamonds in her shoes? Yeah
She walks around like she's got nothin' to lose
Yeah, she's a go-getter, she's everybody's type
She's a queen of the city but she don't believe the hype
She's got her own elevation, holy motivation
So I wrote some letters out in big bold type

I got faith in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith

14,Overjoyed,"[Verse 1]
Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away
Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

[Chorus]
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

[Verse 2]
Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

[Chorus]
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

[Outro]
And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over you
Over you",Stevie Wonder,Soul

[Verse 1]
My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the milky way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine
In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

[Chorus]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la

[Verse 2]
Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

16,Part-Time Lover,"[Verse 1]
Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 2]
If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's ""discreet"" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek it's really you my part-time lover

[Chorus]
We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

We are undercover passion on the run, yeah
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

[Verse 3]
I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers

Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me
And somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of

Not like it's hurt me before
For once, I have something I know won't desert me

20,Knocks Me Off My Feet,"[Verse 1]
I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said

We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind

Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find

22,Lately,"[Verse 1]
Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind

Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask, ""Will you be coming back soon?""
You don't know, never know

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart

Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed

[Chorus]
Well, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes
I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
‘Cause they always start to cry
‘Cause this time could mean goodbye",Stevie Wonder,Soul
23,Talkbox Medley (Close To You / Never Can Say Goodbye),"[Verse 1]
Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time that you are near to me baby?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And golden starlight in your eyes
So true
And that is why

Never can say goodbye
No, no, no, no
Never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
There's a very strange vibration
Piercin' me right to the core
It says, ""Turn around you fool
You know, you love her more and more""

Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, girl
Ooh, ooh, baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no, no no no, no no no

I never can say goodbye...",Stevie Wonder,Soul

28,I Was Made to Love Her,"[Verse 1]
I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then

But I told them time and time again
""Don't you know I was made to love her
Build my world all around her""

I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

[Verse 7]
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Build my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gon' leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey, ooh wee, baby",Stevie Wonder,Soul
29,Never Dreamed You’d Leave in Summer,"[Verse 1]
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
I thought you would go then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer
But my quiet nights will be spent alone

[Verse 2]
You said there would be warm love in springtime
That is when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone

[Verse 3]
You said then you'd be the life in autumn
Said you'd be the one to see the way
No I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find my love has gone away

Why didn't you stay?",Stevie Wonder,Soul
30,Visions,"[Verse 1]
People hand in hand
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land?
Where hate's a dream and love forever stands
Or is this a vision in my mind?

[Verse 2]
The law was never passed
But somehow all men feel they're truly free at last
Have we really gone this far through space and time
Or is this a vision in my mind?

[Chorus 1]
I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only turn to brown
When autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending

[Verse 3]
But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away
To the vision in our mind?

[Chorus 1]
I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only change to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending

[Verse 3]
But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to take our wings and fly away
To the vision in our minds?",Stevie Wonder,Soul
31,All In Love Is Fair,"[Verse 1]
All is fair in love
Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say
But all is changed with time
The future none can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery

[Chorus]
But all is fair in love
I had to go away
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

[Verse 2]
All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay
But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The losing side I'll play

[Chorus]
But all is fair in love
I should never have left your side
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair

[Outro]
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair",Stevie Wonder,Soul
32,Summer Soft,"[Verse 1]
Summer Soft
Wakes you up with a kiss to start the morning off
In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus
She brings gifts through her breeze
Morning Rain
Gently plays her rythms on your window pane
Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
To bring rain or sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
And so you wait to see what she'll do
Is it sun or rain for you
But it breaks your heart in two
When you find it's October

[Chorus]
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone
Taking with her summer's play

[Verse 2]
Winter Wind
Whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer he begins
Forcing dangers 'way with his breeze
Morning snow
Plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when he never lets you know
If it's snow or clear days you'll find

[Pre-Chorus]
And so you wait to see what he'll do
Is it sun or snow for you
But it breaks your heart in two
Cause you've been fooled by April

[Chorus]
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

[Outro]
You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone

You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

You find it's October
And she's gone
And she's gone
Summer's gone

You've been fooled by April
And he's gone
And he's gone
Winter's gone

Nam-bam-bam-bam-bam wooh",Stevie Wonder,Soul
33,That Girl,"[Verse 1]
That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart
She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescue of love that you'll leave torn apart
That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
Cause she can please her man
She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long

[Chorus]
Before I tell her that I love her
That I want her
That my mind and soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to
That I need to do all that I have to
To be in her love

[Verse 2]
I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true
I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do
That girl, That girl
That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word

[Chorus][x4]

[Outro]
That girl, that girl, that girl
Oh, That girl, that girl, that girl, that girl",Stevie Wonder,Soul
34,You and I (We Can Conquer the World),"[Verse 1]
Here we are on earth together, it's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you
Will it stay, the love you feel for me?
Will it stay, that you will be by my side?
To see me through until my life is through

[Hook 1]
Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I

[Verse 2]
I am glad at least in my life I found someone
That may not be here forever to see me through
But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

36,Too High,"[Chorus]
I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky
I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky

[Verse 1]
She's a girl in a dream
She sees a four eyed cartoon monster on the T.V. screen
She takes another puff and says ""It's a crazy scene""
That red is green
And she's a tangerine

I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't left the ground
I'm too high
I'm too high
I hope I never ever come down

But her world's a superficial paradise
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But no dice
She wasn't very nice

I'm too high
I'm too high
I can't ever touch the sky
I'm too high
I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to die

She's a girl of the past
I guess that I got to her at last
A did you hear the news about the girl today
She passed away
What did her friend say

[Outro]
They said she's too high
Too high
Can't hang around anyway...",Stevie Wonder,Soul
37,If It’s Magic,"[Intro]
If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poet's endless rhyme
Like the galaxies in time

[Verse 1]
If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells

[Chorus]
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

[Verse 2]
So
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child

[Chorus]
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst

[Outro]
So
If it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone",Stevie Wonder,Soul

Kind of heaven eyes
Closing both my eyes
Waiting for surprise

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys

When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care

One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today

40,You Haven’t Done Nothing,"[Verse 1]
We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you

[Chorus]
But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views

But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers

Telling us how you are changing right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views

43,Joy Inside My Tears,"[Verse 1]
I've always come to the conclusion that 'but' is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on ones head
So I have tried to not be the one who'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside I think you should know

Would you like to go with me
Down my dead end street?
Would you like to come with me
To Village Ghetto Land?
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals from garbage cans

Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink, drunk to all demands

Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the streets
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land?

45,These Three Words,"[Verse 1]
When was the last time
That they heard you say
Mother or father, I love you
And when was the last time
That they heard you say
Daughter or son, I love you

Ones you say you cherish every day
Can instantly be taken away
Then you'd say I know this can't be true
When you never took the time
To simply tell them ""I love you""

[Verse 2]
When was the last time
That they heard you say
Sister or brother, I love you
And when was the last time
That they heard you say
Darling or best friend, I love you

The one for whom you'd give your very life
Could be taken in the twinkling of an eye
Through your tears you'd ask why did you go
Knowing you didn't always show
Just how much you loved them so

[Chorus]
These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside

[Bridge]
I know a family
Who hasn't a cent to their name
And yet the joy and love they have between them
They always claim
And when one's called from life
The survived mourn the lost
And will never be the same
Yet they rejoice
In knowing they gave them their all

[Chorus]
These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words, these three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside
These three words
Sweet and simple, oh sweet simple
These three words
These three words, these three words, these three words
Short and kind
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside

Worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell

47,Saturn,"[Intro]
Packing my bags-going away
To a place where the air is clean
On Saturn
There's no sense to sit and watch people die
We don't fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes

[Verse 1]
There's no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just can't be bought-or sold
Tell me why are you people so cold

[Chorus]
I'm going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars 'cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high

[Verse 2]
We have come here many times before
To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men, women and children
That don't even know what they're dying for
We can't trust you when you take a stand
With a burning bible in your hand
With a cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy

[Chorus]
I'm going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars 'cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high",Stevie Wonder,Soul
48,Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You),"[Verse 1]
Mary wants to be a superwoman
But is that really in her head?
But I just want to live each day to love her
For what she is
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind?
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind

[Chorus]
But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, and I think I can be very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can cope with everything going through your head

[Verse 2]
Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that she will get by with a dream?
My woman wants to be a superwoman
And I just had to say goodbye
Because I can't spend all my hours starting to cry

[Chorus]
But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, think that I know you very well
Wish you knew me like I know you, very well
But I think I can deal with everything going through your head
(Your filthy head)

[Bridge]
Very well, dum dum da, dum dum da
Very well, wish you knew me too very well
And I wish I could think of everything going through your head
Very well, dum dum da, dum da, dum da
Dum dum da, dum da, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head

[Verse 3]
When the summer came you were not around
Now the summer's gone and love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
When the winter came, you went further south
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past
When the winter came, you were not around
Through the bitter winds, love could not be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
Oh, I need you, baby; I need you, baby

Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past, oh
Spring will fill the air, you will come around
Is it summer love that will let me down?
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Right now, right now, right now

[Outro]
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my dear?
I need you, baby; I need you, baby; I need you, baby
I need you, baby; I need you, baby; I need you, baby
Oh, where were you when I needed you last winter, last winter
Yeah, need you, baby, need you, need you, baby
Oh, you want me to need you, baby
Oh, where were you when I needed you last, dear, yeah",Stevie Wonder,Soul
49,Ordinary Pain,"[Intro]
When by the phone
In vain you sit
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just
An ordinary pain in your heart

[Verse 1]
When you by chance
Go knock on her door
Walking away you're convinced that it's much more
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain in your heart

[Chorus]
Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart

[Verse 2]
When you catch up
But she says goodbye
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart
Tell her you're glad
It's over in fact
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back
Taking that ordinary pain from your heart
It's more than just
An ordinary pain from your heart

[Chorus]

Don't fool yourself
But tell no one else
That it's more than just
An ordinary pain
In your heart


[Verse 3]
You're just a masochistic fool
Because you knew my love was cruel
You never listened when they said
Don't let that girl go to your head
But like a play boy you said no
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
This little girl mind you will blow
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
But then I blew you out the box
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
When I put my stuff on key and lock
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
It makes me feel kind of sick
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
To know love put you in a trick
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
I knew our love would have to end
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
The day I made it with your friend
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
Giving your love to one unreal
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
Like a big fool I know you feel
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
But in this lovie-dovie game
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
With all its joy there must be pain
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
But now the time has surely come
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
This game don't seem like so much fun
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
You're crying big crocodile tears
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
Don't match the ones I've cried for years
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
When I was home waiting for you
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
You were out somewhere doing the do
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
You know I'd really like to stay
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
But like you did I've got to play
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
You're dumb to think I'd let you be
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
Scott free without some pain from me
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
I heard your song and took a chance
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
But to your music I can't dance
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
Go tell your story 'sob-sad'
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
About you blowing what you had
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
Since one ain't good enough for you
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)
Then do yourself see how you do
(Or-di-nary pain, ordinary pain)

If they take me back to Texas
They won't take me back alive""

She reached down and picked the gun up
That lay smoking in his hand
She said, ""Father please forgive me
I can't make it without my man""

And she knew she couldn't win
But her final prayer was answered
When the rifles fired again

20,Say No More,"[Verse 1]
Say no more
I think you'll never understand
I have refused the same demand
All my life
Say no more
In my book there can be no blame
When you pretend I have no shame
You're half right!
All along
You kept trying to pin me down
Turn me into your house clown
If I don't fit the bill
All the same
I loved you then
I love you still!

[Bridge]
Want to know the truth?
I caught a nasty bug
And when it got a hold of me
I could not shake it free
A lasting blue note
Has been haunting me
It's like an old mistress
Forever chasing me

[Verse 2]
But say no more
I may not be an easy man
But the way you played your hand
I couldn't stand
It's too bad
There's much more we could have done
But now those days are dead and gone
Nothing lasts
All along
You made me feel this useless guilt
Can you look back on what we built?
I wonder what you saw in me
Tell me, was it real?
Was it love?
You tell me

[Bridge]
Want to know the truth?
I caught a nasty bug
And when it got a hold of me
I could not shake it free
Same lonely blue note
Has been haunting me
It's like an old mistress
Forever chasing me

And though you think of it
As the cause of my fall
Never mind, I'm blessed
I'm here at all",Ray Charles,Soul

If I could
I'd protect you from the sadness in your eyes
Give you courage in a world of compromise

If I could
I would teach you all the things I've never learned
And I'd help you cross the bridges that I've burned
Yes, I would

[Bridge]
If I could
I would try to shield your innocence from time
But the part of life I gave you isn't mine
I've watched you grow, so I could let you go

[Verse 2]
If I could
I would help you make it through the hungry years
But I know that I could never dry your tears
But I would If I could

[Bridge]
Yes, If I live
In a time and place where you don't wanna be
You don't have to walk along this road with me
My yesterday won't have to be your way
If I knew
I would try to change the world I brought you to
And there isn't very much that I could do
But I would If I could

[Outro]
Oh baby
Daddy wants to protect you
And help my baby through the hungriest
Because you're part of me
And if you ever ever need
Said a shoulder to cry on
Or just someone to talk to
I'll be there, I'll be there
I didn't change the world
But I would if I could
Oh darling, I love you, baby",Ray Charles,Soul
22,Mother,"[Chorus]
And i surely still do miss my mother
Doesn't matter how old that i grow
Mother's love will stay with me all through life
No matter where i go
Ever since the lord called
And she left us
Parts of her flow through me
Every day
God has taken her
But no one could ever take
Mother's love away

[Verse 1]
Mama could be strong but you knew that she loved you
She taught me how to walk and talk and pray
Since she's gone on a heaven
All those memories of those days
And i think of the things that i didn't get a chance to say

And i surely still do miss my mother
Doesn't matter how old that i grow
Mother's love will stay with me all through life
No matter where i go
Ever since the lord called
And she left us
Parts of her flow through me
Every day
God has taken her
But no one could ever take
Mother's love away

[Verse 2]
Always there the first thing the morning
Making sure that i got up for school
Get yourself ready to go
She said go to class and learn some more
And remember that there's no one in the word better than you
That's why i miss my mother

[Verse 3]
There ain't no blues that have been written
That could make me feel this way
I lost the one that was there for me all my life
The day the Lord took mama far away

A cousin of mine who's gone on, but we'd like to
Kinda carry on in his name
I sing.""

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river
And wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul?
Put my feet on the ground

I don't know why she treated me so bad
Look at all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Hold me, love me, please me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't, can't take no more

Take me to the river

I don't know why I love you like I do

The sixteen candles are burning on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all

I wanna know, can't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

I wanna know
Take me to the river
I wanna know
Want you to dip me in the water
I wanna know
Won't you wash me in the water?
Wash me in the water
Wash me in the water

42,So You’re Leaving,"[Verse 1]
So you're leaving me today
Just because of what they say
You took their word against mine

Before you walk out the door
Let me say just once more

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill?
He sounds too good to fly
The midnight train whining low

One step ahead of misery
One step is all I'd have to take backwards
To be the same old fool for you I used to be

I'm only one step ahead of your arms
One kiss away from your sweet lips
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips

Your warm breath on my shoulder
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you
It's too late to be free, can't you see?

I'm only one step ahead of your love
I try and yet I can't take two
Seems like I'll have to take that one step backwards

Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Just one step ahead is a step too far away from you",Aretha Franklin,Soul

Ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
Ain't no way for me to give you all you need
If you won't let me give all of me

[Verse 1]
I know that a woman's duty
Is to help and love a man

Oh but how can I, how can I, how can I
Give you all the things I can
If you're tying both of my hands?

Stop trying to be someone you're not
How cold and cruel is a man
Who paid too much for what he got?
And if you need me like you say, say you do
Oh then please, please
Please don't you know that I need you?

[Chorus]
Oh, it ain't no way
I tell you that it ain't no way
It ain't no way, it ain't no way, baby, no

It sure ain't no way
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
No way
If you won't let me
Ain't no way",Aretha Franklin,Soul

Before I put on my makeup
I say a little pray for you
While combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part

Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you

And all through my coffee break time

Like a warrior that fights and wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally

Oh, I escaped (Aha ha)
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me

Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like a bridge that's on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

17,A Rose is Still a Rose,"[Intro]
Listen, dear
I realise that you've been hurt, deep
Because I've been there
But regardless to who, what, why, when and where
We're all precious in his sight
And a rose is still, and always will be, a rose

Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm

[Verse 1]
There was a rose I knew, I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey hey
She never knew what hit her, oh
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

[Verse 2]
Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you, it's you, nobody else
And now you're so tough, tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh, oh, yeah
When she gets nearer
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you

Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see you're lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Don't believe that life is over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself enough to know
That without him, your life goes on
Without him, your life goes on
And without him, your life goes on

'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower

And I asked him, ""Brother
Could you help me, please?""
He said, ""Good sister
I'd like to but I'm not able""

I was right back down
Down on my bended knees, yes I was, oh

I thought that I wouldn't last for long
But somehow, right now
I believe that I'm able, I'm able to carry on
I tell you that it's been a long
And oh, it's been an uphill journey, all the way
But I know, I know, I know
I know my change is gonna come

I had to cry all night long, yes I did
Sometimes
I had to give up right, for what I knew was wrong

And oh, yeah, that man takes care of all of my pains and my ills

And takin' care of business is really this man's game
And after one visit to Dr. Feelgood
You'll understand why Feelgood is his name

Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along

Sometimes it hurts to even laugh

There is a fountain that I see
Filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's vein
The sinners, sinners plunged beneath that blood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
The sinners, sinners plunged beneath, beneath that blood
They're gonna lose all their guilty stains

38,Angel,"[Intro]
I got a call the other day
It was my sister Carolyn, saying
""Aretha, come by when you can
I've got something that I wanna say""

[Bridge]
And when I got there she said
""You know rather than go through a long drawn out thing
I think the melody on the box will help me explain""

[Chorus]
Gotta find me an angel
To fly away with me
Gotta find me an angel
Ooo and set me free

[Verse]
My heart is without a home
I don't want to be alone
I gotta find me an angel
In my life, in my life
Too long have I loved
So unattached within
So much that I know
That I need somebody so
So I will just go on
Hoping that I find me someone
Gotta find me an angel in my life
In my life...in my life
I know there must be someone
Somewhere for me
Oh I lived too long
Without the love of someone
And there's no misery
Ooooh oooh like the misery
I feel in me

[Chorus]
I gotta find me an angel in
In my life
(You'll meet him now don't you worry)
In my life
(Keep looking and just keep cooking)
In my life
(He'll be there, now don't you worry)
In my life",Aretha Franklin,Soul

41,Willing To Forgive,"[Verse 1]
I read her letters
And I saw her picture
And I smelled her cheap perfume
It must have come from you
How could you touch her?
Lay down beside her?
Well, there just ain't no excuse
You shouldn't have been so loose

[Pre-Chorus]
I saw the telephone bill
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can smooth it over
Then you're wasting your time

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

[Verse 2]
You're such a liar
You took her and her children
Out for the afternoon
While I was sittin' waitin' on you
How could you do it?
You should've been here with me
You just couldn't do it
You had to be in the streets

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I heard through the grapevine
You've been messin' around
When you thought you were gettin' over
That's when a baby girl found out

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(You really hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

[Bridge]
I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess (Guess I) I'm in love

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
(Oh, baby, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(Ooh, you really hurt me this time, baby)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit (Although I must admit)
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time
(I'm gonna mess around some time)

[Bridge]
I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, I washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess I...I'm in love

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(Ooh, oh, baby, you hurt me, you hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget

I had a dream of days gone by
When hopes were high
And life worth living

No song unsung, nothing was wasted

With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your dreams apart
As they turn your dreams
To shame, shame, shame, shame

He walked the summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
Oh, but he was gone when autumn came
Oh yes he was

I stand right here and dream he'll come to me
ANd then we will, then we will
Then we will live this life together
But there are dreams that cannot
That cannot, that cannot be

I had a dream, had a dream
Listen, world, I had a dream
That life would be so different, so different
Whatever happened to it? Oh, the dream, yeah

Life must not kill the dream
That we dream, oh, oh, oh no",Aretha Franklin,Soul

Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standing
Well, who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar

1,Dance With My Father,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother
Would disagree
To get my way I would run
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
Yeah yeah
Then finally make me do
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

I know I'm praying for much to much
But could you send her
The only man she loved
I know you don't do it usually
But Dear Lord
She's dying to dance with my father again

Every night I fall asleep
And this is all I ever dream",Luther Vandross,Soul
2,A House is Not a Home,"[Verse 1]
A chair is still a chair
Even when there's no one sittin' there
But a chair is not a house
And a house is not a home
When there's no one there to hold you tight
And no one there you can kiss goodnight
Woah girl

[Verse 2]
A room is a still a room
Even when there's nothin' there but gloom
But a room is not a house
And a house is not a home
When the two of us are far apart
And one of us has a broken heart

[Refrain]
Now and then I call your name
And suddenly your face appears
But it's just a crazy game
When it ends, it ends in tears

[Verse 3]
Pretty little darling, have a heart
Don't let one mistake keep us apart
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
Oh, please be there
Sayin' that you're still in love with me, yeah

[Verse 4]
I'm not meant to live alone
Turn this house into a home
When I climb the stairs and turn the key
Oh, please be there, still in love
I said, still in love
Still in love with me, yeah

Are you gonna be in love with me?
I want you and need you to be, yeah
Still in love with me
Say you're gonna be in love with me
It's drivin' me crazy to think
That my baby couldn't be still in love with me

Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
Are you gonna be? Say you're gonna be
Well well, well well

Still in love, so in love, still in love with me
Are you gonna be?
Say that you're gonna be
Still in love with me, yeah

With me, oh
Still in love with me, yeah",Luther Vandross,Soul
3,I’d Rather,"I thought sometime alone
Was what we really needed
You said this time would hurt more than it helps
But I couldn't see that
I thought it was the end
Of a beautiful story
And so I left the one I loved at home to be alone (alone)
And I tried to find
Out if this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah

And then I met someone
And thought she could replace you
We got a long just fine
We wasted time because he was not you
We had a lot of fun
Though we knew we were faking
Love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies
So I'm here cause I found this one thing is true
That I'm nothing without you
I know better now
And I've had a change of heart

I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Who holds my heart

I can't blame you if you turn away from me, like I've done you
I can only prove the things I say with time
Please be mine

I'd rather have bad times with (please be mine) you
Than good times with someone else (I know)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (anytime)
Than safe and warm by myself (so sure baby)
I'd rather have hard times to gether
Than to have it easy apart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart (my heart)

I'd rather have bad times with you (surely)
Than good times with someone else (surely)
I'd rather be beside you in a storm (oh yeah)
Than safe and warm by myself (all by myself)
I'd rather have hard times together
Than to have it easy apart (you know it)
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart

I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart
Whoooo.....who holds my heart",Luther Vandross,Soul

9,Take You Out,"Here it is...

She caught me by surprise, I must say
'Cause I never have seen a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style

I was fascinated surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say...

[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?
To a movie, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?

[Verse 2]
Don't care if I get rejected
At least then I won't regret
Regret the fact I missed the chance for romance, at least
I'll walk away knowing, I tried my best and I'm going
I'm going on with my day
'Cause at least she heard me say...

Excuse me miss, but what's your name?

10,The Impossible Dream,"[Orchestral intro]

To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
And to run where the brave dare not go

To right the unrightable wrong
And to love pure and chaste from afar
To try when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star

This is my quest
To follow that star
Ooh, no matter how hopeless
No matter how far
To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march, march into hell
For that heavenly cause

And I know
If I'll only be true
To this glorious quest
That my heart
Will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest

And the world will be better for this
Oh, that one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable, the unreachable
The unreachable star

The unreachable star",Luther Vandross,Soul

13,Buy Me A Rose,"He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart cause nothing's for her heart
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
If he could only read her mind, she’d say

[Chorus]
Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
As she sits and wonders if all she's doing is wrong
Cause lately she’d try anything just to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said, if she said

[Chorus]

And the more that he lives the less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives the more that he sees
This is the story of you and me

So I bought you a rose on the way home from work
To open the door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes
Cause I'm gonna make things right for the rest of your life
And I’m gonna hold you tonight, tonight
Do all those little things for the rest of your life",Luther Vandross,Soul

I've wished for you in my heart and in my head
And I got my answer that first moment that we met
And, oh yes, I believed you as you told me, as you said
You'd be here every year, every Christmas

There must be a lesson for me to learn
If you don't trust in love, you'll get nothing in return
Why should I be lonely? Don't tell me it's fine
I have my pride, but I'd rather be with you tonight

So much emotion, it's driving me mad, yeah, yeah
But I'll take my chances with these feelings that I have
And I'll come back to this same corner where we met
And I'll be here every year, every Christmas

Mere words can't explain the pain and the fear
'Cause, oh, I wonder, yes I wonder, are you gonna leave me standing here?
Today's almost over, but I don't wanna leave
Has my heart made a fool out of me?

My friends gather 'round me with holiday cheer, yeah
They say to forget you, to let you go 'cause you're not here

17,There’s Nothing Better Than Love,"[Verse 1]
[Luther Vandross]
I, fell asleep late last night...
And I dreamed the night and almost half the day away
I just got up
So that I could hear her say
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away

[Gregory Hines]
Ooh love, wakes me up every day
And I thought no one
Could ever make me feel this way
It fills me up
Every time I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away

[Chorus]
I wanna be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love
To love

[Verse 2]
[Luther]
And I mean all these words I say
You don't have to guess
What's going on inside my head

[Gregory]
Just try to know
All the things that our hearts say
Listen to love
And always get love to lead the way

[Chorus]
Whenever you love
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love

[Bridge]
(For love, for love)
You know for love I would go anywhere
(For love) I would go there
(For love, for love)
For love to the ends of nowhere
It's for her love
And for her love
I would go
I would go
I would go
I would go...

[Verse 3]
[Gregory]
And I would love (would love)
To just spend all my time
With a girl
Who makes me feel her love is mine

[Luther]
Someone you see
Who would only dream of me
She'd be in love
Just 'cause she'd want to be

[Chorus]
She'd want to be loved
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love

Oh, oh...
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love

Oh, oh...
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love",Luther Vandross,Soul
18,If I Didn’t Know Better,"I think sometimes I can read your mind
When you make things up I can tell you lie
I see the things that your man can’t see
And I wonder what kind of man is he
The one who you say is your lover
Who you insist takes care of you under the covers
And who is there for you and loves you like no other
Then you kiss and tell me that you love me like a brother

If I didn’t know better
I’d think that you were mine, you’re with me all the time
If I didn’t know better
I’d swear we’re more than friends, you’re touching me again
If I didn’t know better
I’d think we were in love
Girl, do you wanna tell me something?
Oh, oh, oh

I could be wrong about the things you say
But I don’t rub up on my friends that way
You tell me that you’ve always been a flirt
But if it goes wrong, I could get hurt
But no, you insist it’s harmless playin’
It’s just a part of who you are, that it’s just your nature
And that it’s fine
You know I’m a friend, it’s really nothing
You say that I’m just like a…
That I’m just like a brother


If I didn’t know better
I’d think that you were mine, you’re with me all the time
If I didn’t know better
I’d swear we’re more than friends, you’re touching me again
If I didn’t know better
I’d think we were in love
Girl, do you wanna tell me something?
Oh, oh, oh

My idea of a friend is when you
Do a lotta things together and have a lotta fun
But my definition of love is different
You touch and hold each other
And you only want to be alone clinging to each other
Like you and he should be, but like you and I are
Well, I know it sounds crazy but…


If I didn’t know better
I’d think that you were mine, you’re with me all the time
If I didn’t know better
I’d swear we’re more than friends, you’re touching me again
If I didn’t know better
I’d think we were in love
Do you wanna tell me something?
Oh, oh, oh

If I didn’t know better
I’d think that you were mine, you’re with me all the time
If I didn’t know better
I’d swear we’re more than friends, you’re touching me again
If I didn’t know better
I’d think we were in love
Girl, do you wanna tell me something?

If I didn’t know better

You're going to be in trouble
I hope your mama don't look in your room

She'll be here soon

29,Since I Lost My Baby,"[Verse 1]
The sun is shining, there's plenty of light
A new day is dawning, sunny and bright
But after I've been crying all night
The sun is cold and the new day seems old

[Chorus]
Since I lost my baby
Oh, since I lost my baby

[Verse 2]
The birds are singing and the children are playing
There's plenty of work, and the bosses are paying

But fun is a bore, and with money I'm poor

'Til I find her, I'll be trying to ('Til I find her, I'll be trying to)
Every day I'm growing kinder
Tryin'...inclined to...find her
Inclined to find my baby (My baby)
I've been looking everywhere (My baby)
Hey baby, I really really care
I care, I care...

[Verse 3]
My determination is fading fast, so fast, so fast
Inspiration is a thing of the past
I can't see how my hope's gonna last

I know she'll come into my life

33,Too Proud to Beg,"Love came to me that day
Stayed longer than I planned
But change is good, they say
So I rearranged my world for them
For her and love and, here I go again

I spoke to my heart
Said, ""Open up wide""
Then got the message you had changed your mind
And now here I am, and I just don't understand

Baby, if you talk to me then I will listen
There can't be no ""us"", honey, if ""you"" are missin'
Yes I love you, yes I need you
Ain't no world for me without you
I want you, I'm just too proud to beg

So sad the journey made
So high the price you have to pay
All for love
And it hurts you anyway
I can't let me lose my soul to hope and wishing
You don't understand me, I know that you think...

I don't love you, I don't need you
But, my intentions are to love you
See, I want you, I'm just too proud...
To beg for your love, honey
So don't put me through it
Take a little time to think about what you're doing
And try to understand why...

Yes I love you, yes I need you
Ain't no world for me without you
I want you, I'm just too proud to beg
Yes I love you, yes I need you

35,Don’t Want To Be a Fool,"[Verse 1]
Love, what have you done, oh wow
I was sure up 'til now
That she was a friend
I stayed 'til the end
(Don't be a fool again)
I once believed that love was fair
But I don't anymore
She said I'm a bore
My heart hit the floor
(Don't be a fool anymore)

[Pre-Chorus]
Each time around I tell myself
""It's the game of love""
Ignore the signs and risk it all in the name of love
Well, I've decided I can't let nobody hurt me again
So I'll say it 'til the end

[Chorus]
I just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool ever again

[Verse 2]
Whenever a fool's in love
He doesn't know he's to blame
He's caught in the game
It all ends up the same
(He doesn't feel the shame)
He looks at love in a different way
It breaks his heart every time
They all turn estranged
But he'll never change
(He's never gonna change)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, next time around I'll tell myself
""It'll be better than before""
I won't look back, there'll be no one
Tearing my heart out anymore, my baby
I've just decided I can't let nobody fool me again
So I'll swear 'til the end

[Chorus]
I just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool ever again

[Bridge]
(No way) I mean no more
(Never again) Ooh, no never
(I can't be a fool) Can't be, no way
No way, no way
Ooh, I don't want to be
I don't want to be a fool, no

(I can't love anybody walking on a one way street)
Any way, any way, any way, no
(If I don't find somebody, that'll be alright with me)
I know, I know it'll be alright now
'Cause I decided not to let nobody kill me again
So I'll say it 'til the end

[Chorus]
I just don't wanna be a fool (Don't wanna be a fool)
Said I don't wanna be a fool never, never again

(Don't wanna be a fool) Can't be a fool

Lately love keeps keeping me wake at night
Tossing and turning, my love
Wanna kiss, wanna hold you so tight

Ooh, but I wonder love
Whether you know or not
When you just hurry away
Leaving me laying there in shock

I just wanna be
The one that you wanna see
I just wanna have you near me

But you fly away
Almost every day
You work a lot
You never stop to love

I love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Gotta stop to love

And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
(Gotta stop to love)

[Verse 2:]
You say my love
Has always been on your mind
But how can I ever love you
When you keep working overtime?

Too many empty nights
Can make almost any guy roam
To look for the love he don't get
Whenever he's at home alone

Awaiting the day
That you're coming to stay
I hate to see you go away

But you couldn't rest
Had to be the best
To reach the top
But you did not stop to love

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
And one day you'll discover
I'm the one who loves you
(Gotta stop to love)

And no one does you better
Can't you stay forever
(Stop to love)

I can hardly stand the loneliness
Come on stay
Cause that's what it's all about
You really turn me out

I love you, stop

Love you, stop

Recline your seat, relax, and let's listen to Mr. Vandross
And watching how my mami watching her dude
Creating a situation that put us right in the mood

Especially when we're rocking the songs we make babies to
You know the way we do, baby, and as we lay
I look at you and sit back and think how today was such a lovely day

I know that you've been good to me
And I know it's just a rumor spreading in this town
And I know know know it's a thing I don't believe
'Cause you know I'd never let you down baby

[Pre-Chorus]
This is love that you see on my face
And it's impossible to erase
Still it scares me when I hear what I hear
You see, everybody's talking and they whisper in my ear

[Chorus]
But I know that you would never hurt me
I know you got a real good heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing
Trying for nothing
'Cause nothing's gonna stop our love, love
(Honey, don't you see?)

I know about their jealousy
And I know about the talk that's growing in this town
And I know know know that they don't want to believe
That I'm not just a run-around baby

They say we will break up, just you wait
They gamble on the time and the date it will end
Not much longer, they swear
You see everybody's talking, I hear rumors everywhere

I know you got a real good heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing
Trying for nothing

When they say that we're in trouble

So they just stay busy talking
""She don't love him, he don't love her!""

I know that you would never hurt me
I know you got a real good heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing

I know you got a real big heart
Too bad they're talking for nothing

I can't go on since you've been gone
Sometimes I don't know what I'm living for

See, I don't know what he told you 'bout the better life
His better cars and how he can treat you better

He'll give you more

No, no, no, no

[Chorus]
A better love
A better, better love
Who could love you better?

[Verse 2]
There is no reason
Honey, you should ever worry what I'm doing
While you're gone I'm being true to you
My fire burns for your return
And I'll just dream of you until you do

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I never could replace your love with anyone's
I do believe it's easier said than done
No matter whose promises you dream of
Go search the world
You couldn't find a better love
No, no, no, no, no

A better love
A better, better love
Who could love you better?

I'm ready to make it, don't care about the weather
Don't care about no trouble, got myself together
I feel the kind of protection that's all around me

[Verse 5]
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
With the Trouble Man
Moving, going to town
I come up hard, come on, get down
There's only three things for sure]
I come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby, playing by the rules
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checking trouble, sugar, hey, moving down the line",Marvin Gaye,Soul
9,What’s Happening Brother,"[Verse 1]
Hey baby, what you know good
I'm just getting back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end?
When will people start getting together again?
Are things really getting better, like the newspaper said
What else is new my friend, besides what I read

[Verse 2]
Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friend
Money is tighter than, it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand
What's going on across this land
Ah, what's happening brother?
Yeah, what's happening? What's happening my man?

[Verse 3]
Are they still getting down
Where we used to go and dance
Will our ball club win the pennant
Do you think, they have a chance?
And tell me friend, how in the world have you been?
Tell me, what's out and I want to know what's in

[Verse 4]
What's the deal man
What's happening? Tell me brother
What's happening brother?

What's happening my man?
Whoo, ah, ah, what's happening brother?
Say man, whoo, what's happening brother?

10,Flyin’ High (In the Friendly Sky),"[Verse 1]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Flying high without ever leaving the ground, no
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
Oh Lord, and have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger awaits me
And it's bound to forsake me
So stupid minded
I can't help it, so stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend
But soon the night will bring the pains
The pain, awful pain

[Verse 2]
Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
And I ain't seen nothing but trouble baby
Nobody really understands, no, no
And I go to the place where the good feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hand
Oh Lord, so stupid minded
Oh and, I go crazy when I can't find it
Well I know I'm hooked my friends
To the boy who makes slaves out of men
And oh, believe me

Ooh, so many miles away

Every night, every night
And sometimes I yearn through the day

Distant lover (lover, lover)
You should think about me
Say a prayer for me
Please, please baby
Think about me sometimes
Think about me here
Here in misery
Misery

[Verse 3]
As I reminisce, ah baby
Through our joyful summer together
The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road

[Verse 4]
Distant lover, ooh sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel
Didn't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you
I treasured it
Like it was precious a jewel, oh baby
Lord, have mercy

[Outro]
Oh baby, don't go
Please, come back, baby
Something I want to say

13,Just to Keep You Satisfied,"[Verse 1]
You were my wife, my life, my hopes and dreams
For you to understand what this means, I shall explain
I stood all the jealousy, all the bitching too
Yes, I'd forget it all once in bed with you
Ooo darling how could we end up like this?
Oh baby let me reminisce

[Verse 2]
Oh and when we, woo, stopped the hands of time
You set my soul on fire, my one desire
Was to love you and think of you with pride
And keep you satisfied, oh baby oh baby
We could not bear the mental strain
Leave you, I never meant to
Now you see how much you hurt me
But if you ever need me, I'll be by your side
Though the many happy times we had
Can never really outweigh the bad
Oh I'll never love nobody like I loved you baby

[Verse 3]
It's time for us to say farewell, farewell my darling
Maybe we'll meet down the line
It's too late for you and me, it's too late for you and I
Much too late for you to cry
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you and I
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry baby
Ah we tried, God knows we tried
Now it's too late to live and love and ah it's too late baby
It's too late for you and me, much too late for you to cry

Well, all we can do is, we can both try to be happy",Marvin Gaye,Soul

Don't go and talk about my father
God is my friend, (Jesus is my friend) he is my friend
He made this world for us to live in (He made this world)
And gave us everything (Lord gave us everything)
And all he asks of us (Peace!) is we give each other love, oh yeah

16,"When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You","[Intro] (Spoken)
You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real
I mean, if you think back about what you really said about honor, loving and obeying till death do us part and all
But it shouldn't be that way, it should, it should, it should be lies because it turns out to be lies
If you don't honor what you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed

[Verse 1]
Ooh now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again and again and again, and that isn't all
I gave my love to you each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it

Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby
Ooh if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time

Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger

Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby?
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me with all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part

[Bridge]
I really tried, you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried, all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how hard I tried, really tried
(All that rehearsing, baby)
We really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized, my name

[Verse 2]
What I can't understand is if you love me
How could you turn me in to the police
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could, you were so divine and your love was like mellow wine

Pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, so break away to the new-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend; I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter, babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world
Good luck in the world
But I know you'll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin' by your side

Memories haunt you all the time
I will never leave your mind
Got judgment on your side;
You've said bad things and you've lied

Still I remember some of the good things, baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life

I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared baby
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was
To love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight

It don't matter baby
Take a lesson from it all (come on)
I never thought I'd see the day when
You'd put me through what you put me through
You tried your best
You say I gave you no rest

[Refrain/Outro]
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?",Marvin Gaye,Soul

Hey baby, that's alright people

Everyday, that's alright
Oh, when we love each other

[Verse 1]
I know that's alright
Oh just feel it, feel it
Oh everybody feel it
God know that's alright, yes

[Verse 2]
Some of us were born with money to spend
Some of us were born for races to win
Some of us are aware that it's good for us to care
Some of us feel the icy wind of poverty blowing in the air

[Verse 3]
For those of us who simply like to socialize
For those of us who tend the sick
And heed the people's cries
Let me say to you, right on

[Bridge]
Turn on, on, feel it, feel
Yeah, oh, oh, oh Lord, Lord, people
And I say, right on
Honey, right on

[Verse 4]
For those of us who live where peace is craved
For those of us who live, where hatred is enslaved, alright
For those of us who live a life, yeah
Surrounded by good fortune and wealth, talk about it

[Verse 5]
For those of us who live a life, hey, hey, hey enjoying ourselves
For those of us who got drowned in the sea of happiness
For the soul that takes pride in his God
And himself and everything else

[Verse 6]
Love, love, sweet love, love, wonderful love
Ah, true love, love, love for your brother
And love, love for God
Love, pure love

[Verse 7]
Ah true love can conquer hate every time
Give out some love and you'll find peace sublime
And my darling, one more thing
If you let me, I will take you to live where love is king
Ah, baby",Marvin Gaye,Soul

Dedicated to you
Although perhaps I may not be happy
This is what you want
So I conceded
I hope it makes you happy
There's a lot of truth in it, babe
I don't think I'll have many regrets, baby
Things didn't have to be the way they was, baby
You don't have the right to use the son of mine
To keep me in line
One thing I can't do without
Is the boy whom God gave to both of us
I'm so happy, oh, for the son of mine
So here it is, babe
I hope you enjoy, reminisce, be happy
Think about the kisses and the joy
But there were those other moments too
The times that were cloudy and grey
Bad
But you taught me that was life
May love ever possess you
May peace come into your life
Always think of me the way I was

I don't know if I'm gonna get a yea or nay
Or if I'm gonna do what his honor says

Satisfied

Is that enough, baby
Is that enough
Last you a lifetime
Is that enough
Is that enough
Keep you happy

Up early in the morning with her on my mind
Just to find out all night that I've been crying

Love is supposed to be
Somebody, somewhere, tell her it ain't fair

I'm so glad, babe, so glad that you’re home, oh baby",Marvin Gaye,Soul
29,All the Way Around,"[Verse 1]
Oh, if you want to do it, let's get it on
But how you going to act this time around?
Before we take it off down to the skin
Let's get an understanding
Girl you didn't understand my philosophy
You did not understand
You just ran away from me
Oh I miss you baby
Oh I miss you baby, oh I miss you
You're the best I ever had
You're so bad baby, but I must like you like that
Although you won't let me control this or that
I still find you're where it's at
Ah, now I see you're coming straight to the point
You say the more you get baby, ah, the more you want me
Yeah darling you're not wasting my time
What I see baby is so hard to find
Although you've been all over town baby
Having your affairs I still have to accept you back
Angel though you're promiscuous, I don't mind a bit
Because you're still the greatest lay, even when you're miles away

[Verse 2]
Girl if you run away again
Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made
Was just for old times sake
Staying up waiting for you to come home at night
Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend
So let's be sometime lovers
Oh, baby that's when my poor heart broke up

[Verse 3]
Well if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
If you got a pretty girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
And if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life",Marvin Gaye,Soul
30,Ain’t That Peculiar,"[Verse 1]
Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

[Verse 2]
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby 'till I don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger  (stronger, stronger, stronger)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I cried so much just like a child that's lost its toy
Maybe baby you think these tears i cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears (tears, tears, tears)

Now ain't that peculiar baby?
Peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar, honey?
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes
Ain't it peculiar, darling?",Marvin Gaye,Soul
31,I Met a Little Girl,"I met a little girl, sure was fine
Pretty little thing just about blew my mind
She took me home, and made love to me
I knew right then and there this is where I wanted to be
Most of my life I had been all, all alone
And you're so sweet to me, don't think I'll ever roam
And then one day as time will pass
I had this feeling that our love would last
Nothing could go wrong and it seemed everything I did
Seemed to please you; all the heartaches you hid

Then one night after we made it, and we were through
That's when I decided I wanted to marry you

Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife
To love, hold, and cherish for the rest of your life?
I do, yes I do, I do darlin'
Cause I love you

1964

Once you really loved me
Once I really loved you

1976

Then time would change you
As time would really change me
We thought our love would stand the test of time
And as I sing this song right now I wonder today
If you're a friend of mine

Cry cry cry-I have done some crying
Woman, you have caused my tears to flow
Cry cry cry-d you cry about me?
Do you think about the kind of love we had?

Hal-le, hallelejah
Hal-lelu, I'm free
Hal-le, hallelejah
Hal-lelu, I'm free",Marvin Gaye,Soul

33,Masochistic Beauty,"[Marvin Gaye]
Get your ass in gear
Come closer here
See your passion sweat
Now is it wet?
I'll jam you 'til you faint
You're no saint
I'll rock you 'til your sore
Like a whore
Forget that closet scene
I'm so mean
I'll throw you on the floor
Like before
You say it's not your thing
But still you come
You say you hate my guts
Still want some
You silly little freak
Tryin' to rise
The devil's strong in you
It's in your eyes
The thing that's deep in you
You can't resist
I'm gonna tie you up and have my wish
You do not understand but still you love
The way you worship it is all your thinking of
Everybody knows the thing you love
While you're on your knees
Raise your dress above..
Get down...

...Shut up
You nasty little slave, kiss my feet
Put your face right here and start to eat
Get down...
Shut up...
Get down...
Get up!
If you do it right, you get the pipe
And if you do it wrong, I'll spank you long
I love you, my masochistic beauty
I love you, I love your booty
I love it, my masochistic beauty... Yes
I love you, I love your booty
And it's my duty to spank your booty
And it my duty to spank your booty

[Gordon Banks using vocoder]
It's my duty
To spank your booty

[Marvin Gaye]
I love you
Got to learn
Shutup!
Get down
Get up
Get down
Get up

I know about your thing
You hate yourself
You selfish little bitch
You're in poor health
I'll use you till you moan
And cry so hard
Your guilt becomes your key
To turn to God
Although I am a part of this
Like you
I am a master man
With work to do
You must obey my will
Or face my rod
'Cause if you can't for me
You can't for God

Get down
Get up!
Get down
Get up!

Bitch, are you coming?
Get down

Deception is your game
You've been had
All your men are glad
And you are sad
Most of them were rich
But you are poor
Yet you take their cum
For nothing more
Seems that you're delighted
To fuck fate
You're looking for a way
To close the gate
The things you know you
Should you never do
Despite all the pain
It takes you through

My masochistic beauty",Marvin Gaye,Soul

Anger, can make you old, yes it can
I said anger, can make you sick, children... oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
Rage, there's no room for rage in there
There's no room for rage in here
Line up some place to go to be mad
It's a sin to treat your body bad
When anger really gets the best of us
We've really lost our heads
We often say a lot of things, oh darlin'
Wish we'd never said
Oh, reason is beyond control
And the things we do for spite
Makes me ashamed
And I mean this, baby, makes me want to the things right
Someday soon I hope and pray like Jesus
I'll reach that wiser age
Hope I will learn I really never never profit
From things I do in rage
One more time-anger, oh anger
When it's flaming hot
Anger burns to the bitter end
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout
When it cools I find out too late
I have lost at love, love, love, dear friend
I said, anger will make you sick
Children, oh Jesus
Anger destroys your soul
I ain't gonna let you get the best of me, babe
I'm gonna go somewhere and cool
This is not the way my head's supposed to be, babe
You've got me feelin' like some silly fool
But I know a real nice place where I can go
And feel the way I'm supposed to feel
I don't want to be mad at nobody
I don't want to be feelin' bad

Mariah makes the mountain sounds

Mariah, They call the wind Mariah
Now before I knew Mariahs name
And heard her wail and whining
I had a girl and she had me
And the sun was always shining
O, but then one day I left my girl
I left her far behind me
And now I'm lost, I'm oh so lost
Not even God can find me
Mariah, O, Mariah, They call the wind Mariah
I hear they got a name for rain
And wind and fire only
But when you're lost and all alone
There ain't no words but lonely
And I'm a lost and lonely man
Without a star to guide me

Get a little drunk and you land in jail
In get weary and sick of trying
I'm tired of living and afraid of dying

They were singing 'Nearer My God To Thee'

We kept on singing, nearer my God, nearer my God to Thee
Oh Lord, we kept on singing nearer
Nearer my God, nearer, nearer to Thee
They kept on singing, nearer my, my God, nearer my God to Thee
Oh yes, nearer, nearer

Songs have a feeling
There's a story in every song that we sing
Songs that are known to lift heavy burdens
If all of our troubles, to God we oughta bring

And if we are Christians we ought not to be ashamed
To lift our voices, admire Jesus' name
We ought to be able to sing, nearer, nearer my God to Thee
Oh help me Lord, lift our voices and sing, nearer, nearer, nearer yes

Nearer, I want to get nearer to Thee
When I get lonely I can sing, nearer
Nearer my God to Thee, yes I can

Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock

Now my grandfathers' clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood 90 years on the floor
It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more

Now it was bought on the morn
Of the day that he was born
And it was always his treausure and pride
But it stopped short never to go again when the old man died

Oh, now my grandfather said that of those he could hire
Not a servant so faithful he found
For it wasted no time and it had but one desire
At the close of each week to be wound and it kept in its place
Not a frown on his face
And his hands never hung by its side
But you know that it stopped short
Never to go again when the old man died

Now rang an alarm in the dead of the night
An alarm that for years had been dumb
And we that his spirit was 'plumming' for flight
That his hour for departure had come

Still that clock kept the time
With a soft and muffled chime
As we solemnly stood by his side
But you know that it stopped short
Never to go again when the old man died

You know that it stopped short
Never to go again when the old boy died",Sam Cooke,Soul

Stand by me
Ho, stand by me
Whoa stand now

Ho, stand by me
Whoa stand now
Stand by me

Won't you stand, by me
Ho, stand by me

40,The Riddle Song,"I gave my love a cherry that had no stone
I gave my love a chicken that had no bone
I gave my love a ring that had no end
I gave my love a baby with no cryin'

How can there be a cherry that has no stone
How can there be a chicken that has no bone
How can there be a ring that has no end
How can there be a baby with no cryin'

A cherry when it's bloomin', it has no stone
A chicken when it's pippin' ain't got no bone
A ring when it's rollin', it has no end
And oh, a baby when it's sleepin', there's no cryin'

A baby when it's sleepin'
There's no cryin'",Sam Cooke,Soul
41,Touch the Hem of His Garment,"Whoa, there was a woman in the Bible days
She had been sick, sick so very long
But she heard 'bout Jesus was passin' by
So she joined the gathering throng...

And while she was pushing her way through
Someone asked her, ""What are you trying to do?""
She said, ""If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'll be made whole...""

She cried ""Oh, Lord (Oh, Lord), and whoa, Lord (Oh, Lord)
And oh, oh Lord, and whoa, Lord... (Oh, Lord)""
Said, ""If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'll be made whole...""

And whoa, she spent her money here and there
Until she had no, had no more to spare...
The doctors, they'd done all they could
But their medicine would do no good...

When she touched Him, the Savior didn't see
But still he turned around and cried, ""Somebody touched me...""
She said, ""It was I who just wanna touch the hem of your garment;
I know I'll be made whole right now...""

She stood there cryin', ""Oh... (Oh, Lord) Oh... (Oh, Lord)
And oh, oh Lord, and whoa, Lord... (Oh, Lord)
Said, ""If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'll be made whole right now...""",Sam Cooke,Soul

It's nothing like you hear on the radio
It's nothing like how you dream it at night
'Til you fall until it happens to you
Oh, no, no, no, you don't know what it's like
No, no

People say I'm acting strange
Like I'm in the twilight zone
It's got to be love that's got me out of my mind
I'm somewhere in total disconnection
'Cause I had a total misconception

It's nothing like you hear on the radio
It's nothing like how you dream it at night
'Til you fall until it happens to you

It's nothing like in movies or magazines
Or those romantic novels they write
'Til you fall until it happens to you
Oh, no, no, no, you don't know what it's like

This love is not like my dreams
Or any fantasies I've had
It's taken me to both extremes
Sometimes it's better than good
Sometimes it's worse than bad

Oh, it's nothing like you hear on the radio
It's nothing like how you dream it at night

15,Holly,"Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh...

Holly made the rules
She laid down all the laws
Then broke the ones she made
Most folks would be afraid
To play the games that Holly played

When she was seventeen
She ran away from home
As fast as she could run
Said home was just no fun
There was an awful lot of doing to be done

Holly on a cloud in the sky
Way above the crowd flying high, ooh-ooh...
Holly on a cloud in the sky, yeah
Way above the crowd flying high

Holly made the scene
She's gone to every place
She never should have been
Oh, but she was hanging in
Couldn't tell her nothing then, no

Strangers in the night
Have paid a handsome price
To sleep in Holly's bed
She couldn't see that far ahead
To know that she'd become
One of the living dead

Holly on a cloud in the sky, ooh-ooh...
Way above the crowd flying high, ooh-ooh...

Ooh-ooh-ooh...

Holly was confused
She did some things
That even she could no explain
Oh, but now she's so in pain
The devil running through her veins

Holly on a cloud in the sky, ooh-ooh...
Way above the crowd flying high

How could Holly make such a great mistake
To take that she could beat the rap
In just one fling, it never happened

Holly on a cloud in the sky, ooh, Holly
Way above the crowd flying high
Ooh-ooh-ooh...

Ooh, life is passing by, yeah

Mmm-hmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, mmm, yeah

Vividly I can remember when he and I were boys
'Cause that was when he gave me my very first clue
While rapping about the woman
Who would share our future lives
We both painted a picture that is you

So I'm just a silent partner
In a three-way love affair
A silent partner in a three-way love affair

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

It could have been worse
I mean, what if a stranger had found you first
Since it wasn't me, then I'm glad it was him
'Cause to know you this way is better
Than never to know you at all

A thousand times I've asked myself
If I'd take you if I could
But I'm sworn to silence by the unspoken oath
If we three could talk about it
It might do me some good
But I fear to speak might make me lose you both

So I'm just a silent partner
In a three-way love affair
I'm a silent partner in a three-way love affair
Silent partner, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Happy birthday to you

A few years ago on my birthday
I had just become twenty one
(I remember)
I had a lot to live, said I had a lot to give
Til a man comes to give me a gun

And though that war he sent me to
Didn't claim me
If I'm bitter don't blame me
It's just my soul responding

Don't you try to tell me I'm un-patriotic
I deserve an explanation
I can't help but wonder if you really got it

It's just my soul responding
Soul responding, soul responding

This land once belonged to my father
And to his father before him too
Let me tell you now, I'm on a reservation
Living in a state of degradation
What's a soul suppose to do?

'Cause I'm out, pushin', right?
I'm not in doubt
When it's just my soul responding

To seeing little hungry children
In the land of plenty
Just my soul responding
To doing lots of deeds
But never having any

It's just my soul responding
Soul responding, soul responding

I was born and raised in the ghetto
On the run down side of the track
And there are forces who do everything they can do
To hold me back because my skin is black

Oh but more and more I mind
Hell, it's about time
It's just my soul responding
To being second-class in a land I helped to form
Just my soul responding

To too many roaches and not enough heat
To keep my babies warm
In this land I helped to form
I've got too many roaches and not enough heat
To keep my babies warm

It's just my soul responding

But too much highway's stretching out ahead
'Cause like the wind that's blowing free
There's something wild inside of me
That keeps me moving down the road instead

And I'm driving through life in the fast lane
Another day chasing my dreams
Fantasy and confusion, it's all an illusion
But the fire inside me is burning
The wheels just keep on turning
Searching for just what I can't explain
As long as there's a rainbow
And answers that I don't know
I'll be driving through life in the fast lane

Ooh-ooh-ooh...

It get hard to read the signs
Or count the little yellow lines
That flash by like her picture in my mind
I've said so many sad goodbyes
I've quit asking myself why
Or if what's up ahead's as good
As what I've left behind

And I'm driving through life in the fast lane
Another day chasing my dreams
Fantasy and confusion, it's all an illusion

Wish I could let you know what it had to say

I wished that I could fly away
Instead of kneeling in the sand
Catching teardrops in my hand

I would cross the angry sea
Die in ecstasy
But I'll be a bag of bones
Driving down the road alone

I could write every day and all night
But that's the bottom line, well, well

I think a million thought of many
About you and believe me and never fails
To be way too many to mention
But there's one thought that always prevails

I love you so much
I, I love you so much
I love you so much, so much, so much
I love you so much
If I said all the things in my head
That's the bottom line

Why do I do
Things that make me seem so unconfident
A phrase in love has no need to be fancy
It just needs to be truly meant, truly meant
Truly, truly, truly

I love you so much
I love you so much
I love you so much, so much, so much
I love you so much
I could preach or say a ten-day speech
If I write every day and all night
If I said all the things in my head
No matter what I do, I just love you
That's the bottom line

I love you so much
Baby, I love you so much, so much, so much
I love you so much
I love you so much
I could write every day and all night
But that's the bottom line

I love you so much, so much, so much
Love you, love you, love you, love you
I love you so much...",Smokey Robinson,Soul

48,Do Like I Do,"You got to do like I do, oh, like I do
When we're far apart and your lonesome heart
Makes your eyes wander to somebody new
You might want them so much, you can look but, oh, don't touch

You got to do like I do, recognize desire as a physical need
That you can rise above, oh, like I do
Don't love the one you're with? Search 'til you get with the one you love
Oh, like I do, you got to do like I do

When you're out with your friends and the coupling off begins
And the heavy rappers start to hit on you
If the question is romance, let the answer be, ""No chance""
Do like I do, let it in one ear, right past your smile out of the other

Oh, like I do, don't let another lost soul
Talk you into going undercover, do like I do

I know gossip would take a love so good
And spread the proof of one of us is playing, they been saying
Oh, don't give me that he said, that she said that they said, that we said
On it goes

How the stories starts and stops, nobody knows
But I got my baby
Check them so they know that they can go 'til it freezes over
Oh, like I do

Even if they try 'til the fourth of July
Comes in our door, yeah
They never gonna break us up
If you do like I do

Like I do, oh
Like I do, oh
You got to do like I do
Do like I do",Smokey Robinson,Soul
49,Jasmin,"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...

Jasmin has been running around in circles
Doing crazy things
Jasmin has been idolized by common men
Sought after by kings
She's a lady fair with whom they would share
Their every, every dream
She's a bundle of joy love
She's a femme supreme

Jasmin, well, has in her eyes such a look of love
One glance can turn you out
Jasmin, I've been thinking things since I saw you
I never thought about
Just one look from you was all it took
To make my insides melt
If I read you right, your eyes said you might
Feel the same way that I felt

Ooh-ooh...
Ooh...

In my dream, you see, you belong to me
And it makes me feel so proud
But in reality, to you I just may be
Another longing face in the crowd

Ooh you're feeling me so, baby
Making me love you
How much you don't even know, baby
But you'd better believe
My love is only meant for you

Jasmin, Jasmin, Jasmin
No need in asking
You know that I love you
Even if we never speak
Know that I love you, Jasmin
Know that I need you so
Know that I want you
I know you know

Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real Gs
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Ha ha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know

[Chorus]
See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up! (Yeah)

[Interlude]
Check this out, you motherfuckers know what time it is
I don't even know why I'm on this track
Y'all niggas ain't even on my level

On you bitch-made ass Bad Boy bitches, feel it!

[Verse 2]
Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Mu', pass the MAC and let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!

[Chorus]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

[Verse 3]
Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas gettin' killed with your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (ha ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up!

[Verse 4]
I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring the drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario]
You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face, you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

[Outro]
Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run, hahahaha
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressin' up tryna be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob
When we always on our job?
We millionaires
Killin' ain't fair, but somebody gotta do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep, you wanna fuck with us?
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'?
You're fuckin' with me, nigga
You fuck around and have a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it, bring it!
But we ain't singin', we bringin' drama
Fuck you and yo' motherfuckin' mama!
We gon' kill all you motherfuckers!
Now when I came out I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth
With a motherfuckin' opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this: fuck Mobb Deep! Fuck Biggie!
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label, and as a motherfuckin' crew!
And if you wanna be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!

You know how it is: when we drop records, they felt
You niggas can't feel it, we the realest
Fuck 'em, we Bad Boy killas!",2Pac,Rap
1,Changes,"[Intro]
Ooh, yeah (Ooh)
(Come on, come on)

[Verse 1]
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is

[Chorus]
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Come on, come on)

[Verse 2]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), ""I gotta get paid"" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is

[Chorus]
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)

[Interlude]
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[Verse 3]
And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is

[Chorus]
(Uh)
That's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Things'll never be the same (Yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is)
Aww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)
(I'm tryna make a change)
(You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is, aww, yeah
Some things'll never change",2Pac,Rap
2,Keep Ya Head Up,"[Intro]
Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

[Verse 1]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

[Chorus]
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

[Chorus]
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

[Verse 3]
And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But, huh, please, you got to keep your head up",2Pac,Rap
3,Hail Mary,"[Segue from ""Bomb First""]

[Intro]
Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body (All through your body)
The blow is like a 12-Gauge shotty (Uh) feel me!
(Come with me Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now Do you wanna ride or die)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La la-da-la la la la la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

[Chorus]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

[Verse 1]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

[Verse 2]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga!

[Chorus]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

[Verse 3]
They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

[Verse 4]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up

[Bridge]
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

[Chorus]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary!

4,Dear Mama,"[Verse 1]
You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 2]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hotplate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 3]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)

California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

[Verse 1]
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a

[Verse 2]
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution]

6,Ambitionz Az a Ridah,"[Intro]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

[Verse 1]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

[Verse 2]
It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
(That's all you niggas got?)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

[Verse 3]
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

[Chorus]
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me",2Pac,Rap

Motherfuckin' OG
Roll up in the club and shit, is that right?
All eyes on me

But you know what?

[Verse 1]
I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings
Uhh, bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
Screamin', ""Thug Life"" every time they pass, all eyes on me

[Chorus]
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player (All eyes on me) 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me

Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high

[Bridge]
Hey, to my nigga 'Pac

[Verse 2]
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Mediocres got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right]
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me

[Verse 3]
The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money
Motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me

[Chorus]
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me

[Outro]
Pay attention, my niggas! See how that shit go?
Nigga walk up in this motherfucker and it be like, ""Bing!""
Cops, bitches, every-motherfuckin'-body

I got bustas, hoes, and police watchin' a nigga, you know?
(I live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)
(Livin' life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)
He he he, it's like what they think

8,Life Goes On,"[Chorus]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

[Verse 1]
As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, and life goes on

[Verse 2]
Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!

[Chorus]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, 'cause life goes on

[Verse 3]
Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on

[Chorus]
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

[Outro]
Life goes on, homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga
You gon' be like, ""Goddamn, them niggas came up!""
That's right, baby, life goes on
And we up out this bitch
Hey, Kato! Mental!
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin'
When we get up there, man, don't front
Life goes on
Hold me no more, hold me no more
Yes it do, yes it do, yes it do",2Pac,Rap
9,The Rose That Grew From Concrete,"* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists

[Intro]
You try to plant somethin in the conrete, y'knowhatImean?
If it GROW, and the and the rose petal got all kind of
Scratches and marks, you not gon' say, ""Damn, look at
All the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete""
You gon' be like, ""Damn! A rose grew from the concrete?!""
Same thing with me, y'knahmean? I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin, ""Damn, he did this, he did this,""
Just be like, ""DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?""
That's what they should say, y'knowhatImean?
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty
Y'knowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
I'm just tryin to make somethin...

[Refrain 1]
When no one even cared
The rose it grew from concrete
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet
It came from concrete

[Verse 2]
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but, by keepin its dreams
It, learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared
No one else even cared...
The rose that grew from concrete

[Verse 3]
Did you hear..
Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin' nature's laws wrong
It learned to walk without having feet
Funny it seems but by keeping its dreams
It learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else, even cared

[Refrain 2]
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet (to breathe the fresh air)
It came from concrete (to breathe the fresh air)
(to breathe the fresh air, to breathe the fresh air)

[Outro]
You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its
Tenacity. We would all love it's will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses - this is the concrete - and these are
My damaged petals. Don't ask me why, thank God nigga, ask me how!

10,2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,"[Intro]
Up out of there
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters

[Verse 1]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

[Verse 2]
Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

[Verse 3]
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

[Verse 4]
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

[Verse 5]
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

[Verse 6]
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

[Verse 7]
It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have paper in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

[Verse 8]
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

[Verse 1]
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen' and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

[Chorus]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

[Verse 2]
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

[Chorus]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

[Verse 3]
Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

[Chorus]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
And I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha",2Pac,Rap
12,Only God Can Judge Me,"[Intro]
Only God can judge me (that right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (really)
Only God can judge me now

[Verse 1]
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

[Chorus]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[Flatline]

[Verse 2]
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up strangled, entangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

[Chorus]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[Interlude]
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live

[Verse 3]
Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, ""You can fade him""
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down, that's when ""I'll Be Around""
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

[Verse 4]
Guess you figure you know me, ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs drink them Buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm 'bout to floss some boss player shit with 4-Tay

[Chorus]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[Outro]
Only God man
That right?
That’s real
Hahahahahaha
Fuck everybody else, you know what I’m sayin'?
Man, look here, man
My only fear of death
Is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated, man
That’s for the homie mental
Hehehehe
We up out",2Pac,Rap
13,Me Against the World,"[Chorus]
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

[Verse 1]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is out for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath]
Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

[Verse 2]
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3]
Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

[Chorus]
Me against the world
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby

[Verse 4]
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress]
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world

[Outro]
Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But, uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it",2Pac,Rap
14,I Get Around,"[Intro]
'Round and 'round (Aw yeah)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (I get around)
'Round and 'round
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
(Step up, step-step up, step up)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (stronger than ever)
'Round and 'round

[Verse 1]
Back to get wrecked, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""Bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out]
What you mean you don't know?
Round and round, around we go
I get around, the Underground just don't stop for hoes
Round and round
I get around, still down with the Underground
Round and round, around we go
I get around, yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
Round and round

[Verse 2]
Now you can tell from my everday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (Tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around

[Verse 3]
What's up, love? How you doin'? (all right)
Well, I've been hangin', sangin' tryna do my thang, oh, you heard that I was bangin'
Your homegirl you went to school with? That's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't (uhh)
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know that I get around

[Chorus]
'Round and 'round, around we go
2Pacalypse Now don't stop for hoes, I get around
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round, around we go
Why I ain't call you? Hahahah, please!
'Round and 'round

[Verse 4]
Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips ‘cause I'm watchin'
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone, why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethin' is on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well, if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?
It's a lot of real Gs doin' time
Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get around

[Outro]
'Round and 'round, around we go
'Round and 'round, around we go, uhh
'Round and 'round, around we go
'Round and 'round, around we go
'Round and 'round, 'round we go
'Round and 'round, 'round we go
'Round and 'round, 'round we go, whoa

15,All About U,"[Intro]
Ah, yeah! Hahaha (Yeah)
It's all about you, one time (I'ma say it's all about you, baby, yeah)
Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you (It's all about you) (This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac, you know what I'm sayin'?)
It's all about you (Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, ha! Yeah)

[Verse 1]
You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh 'bout how I got my ass
Caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it? (Hell no)
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, ‘cause this is all about you

[Chorus]
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
It's all about you
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

[Verse 2]
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas ‘cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep though, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah, nigga, it's all about you

[Chorus]
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

[Verse 3]
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

[Verse 4]
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

[Verse 5]
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
(It's all about you)

[Chorus]
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

[Outro]
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit
I mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?
What make that even more fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video!
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah",2Pac,Rap
16,So Many Tears,"[Intro]
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come

[Refrain]
Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

[Verse 4]
And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered many years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears",2Pac,Rap
17,Do for Love,"[Intro]
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, Pac!
Word up, hahahahaha

[Verse 1]
I should've seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

[Chorus]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 2]
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin' low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear, 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the door
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin', I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 3]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision, 'cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Outro]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
Do for love, yeah baby yeah
Do for love",2Pac,Rap
18,Ghetto Gospel,"[Intro]
Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

[Chorus]
Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 1]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel

[Chorus]
Those who wish to follow me
(Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[Verse 2]
Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel

[Chorus]
Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

19,The Rose That Grew From Concrete (Autobiographical),"Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack
in the concrete
Proving nature's laws wrong it learned 2 walk

Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams
it learned 2 breathe fresh air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
when no one else even cared!",2Pac,Rap

Shit, you mothafuckin' right!
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, west side! What?! Bring it on!

[Refrain]
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)

[Verse 1]
Our childhood years recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor — father, forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcisin' all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page, prime time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop

[Interlude]
What?! I'm bustin' on you punk-ass niggas
Run, nigga, run! I'm on yo' ass, nigga
Run, nigga! Duck and hide
When I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga! Yeah, Westside!
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!

[Verse 2]
My girlfriend blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothin' compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend

[Chorus]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

[Verse 3]
I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, ‘cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin' niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war, never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin' by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

[Verse 4]
I love finger-fuckin' you, all of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin' for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy you just wanna be down
Talkin' loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit, you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin

21,Can’t C Me,"[Intro]
The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see the P!
You must be goin' blind

[Verse 1]
Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes, open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe? Nigga, you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money, but baby, I've gots to get mo'
You screamin', ""Go 2Pac!"" and I ain't stoppin' till I'm well-paid
Bail's paid now, nigga, look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by niggas can't see me!

[Chorus]
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't see me

[Verse 2]
Been gettin' word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Sayin' they can get with us, but picture me gettin' served
My own mama say I'm thugged out
My shit be poppin' out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what! It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart, ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
D-R-E, you got me heated; my words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alizé and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down]
Niggas can't see me
They can't see me
Which way did he go, George?
Which way did he go?
Oh!! Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?

You niggas made a mistake
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and it's judgement day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money, then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm gettin' green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker 'cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart; niggas can't see me!

Yo, check this out]
Niggas can't see me
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here
You niggas can't see me

I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face
But you still can't see me
You can't see me
All up in your range, but niggas can't see me
20/20 vision won't visualize
I'm in the flesh, baby, but you can't see me
All those glasses won't help you realize
You blinded, you blinded, you can't see me
You can't see me

Thug Life, baby
Don't believe everything you read!
Alizé and weed
You can't see me, right before your very eyes
You won't even visualize, you can't see me

Niggas can't see me
I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers!
This one's for you, BIG baby
'Cause you bitch-ass niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me

See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil

22,How Do U Want It,"[Chorus]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it yeah?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 1]
I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

[Chorus]
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 2]
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alizé
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

[Chorus]
How do you want it?
How do you  feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you  feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

[Verse 3]
Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?

[Chorus]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game

Hey

Not motherfucking double R, Richie baby
What's happening baby, you know how we do it
Yeah nigga, you know I'm up out this bitch
It's time for me to uhhh regulate
Fo' sho', hey
Observe
And you ain't going back?
Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whassup though
This is for the honeys, the superstar
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me?
Well let 'em know

[Verse 1]
You fucking with niggas that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me 'til you sure
I ain't begging just trying to relocate between your legs
Dripping wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight begging to sex me got you undressing to test me and uhh..

[Verse 2]
Shut me down if you want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared, go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharing skirts

[Verse 3]
I'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is banging, got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of trying to make my songs pay
Making love all day against the wall in the hallway
Your fantasies come alive, your heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga

[Chorus]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
('Cause) These busters ain't loving you right

[Verse 4]
Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see you blushing like you want something
Come get a taste of Amerikaz Most Wanted
And let's get into some touching, erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of busting until you learn your lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass

[Verse 5]
You can ride out with sport coat, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga and sport coat can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep you on the sidelines

[Chorus]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right

[Verse 6]
Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got you naked
Totally sweating, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissing 'til yo' head swang
I'm so into you, witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know
Now scream my name out; do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss player, freaky motherfucker, can I dig?

[Verse 7]
It's on and popping, now you see what I was seeing
Why your eyes rolling? Loosen up, girl, I ain't going
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold the boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm going home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You're in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga

[Chorus]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
So I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life

24,Brenda’s Got a Baby,"[Intro]
Brenda's got a baby
Brenda's got a baby

[Verse]
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
""That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family""
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say ""you makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day""
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby",2Pac,Rap

Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took five like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed 'em out

Done seen too many real players fall
To let these bitch niggas beat me

I heard he was light-skinned, stocky, with a Haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashin'
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin' for the feds
Same crime, different trials, nigga, picture what he said
And did I mention?
Promised to payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin', the world is mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love

To the truest shit I ever spoke
I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote; against all odds

[Verse 3]
Puffy gettin' bribed like a bitch, to hide that fact
He did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ridin' for that
And that nigga that was down for me, restin' dead
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin' or dead
Lord, listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written
Ayo, Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard my melody (This nigga sounds like Rakim!)
Read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life
So what's a ""chazzer,"" Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right
You've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die — goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me? Nigga

[Hook]
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
Against all odds, hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke; against all odds

[Outro]
21-gun salute, one love to my true thug niggas
(Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
21-gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
Representin' to the fullest, bein' soldiers with military minds
That play the rules of the game, 21-gun salute
I salute you, my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you bitch-made niggas, I'm comin' for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is
You touch me, I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers didn't think I forgot
Hell nah, I ain't forgot, nigga
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war unless I got my money right
I got my money right now, now I want war",2Pac,Rap
26,Until the End of Time,"[Verse 1]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

[Hook]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 2]
Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

[Hook]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[Verse 3]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time",2Pac,Rap
27,Picture Me Rollin’,"[Intro]
Yeah, clear enough for ya? (alright)
Why niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas!

[Verse 1]
Picture me rollin' in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance
That's what somebody be tellin'
Know there's dope bein' sold, but I ain't the one sellin'
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin' at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossin' a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin'
And my hands are swollen
Thinkin' of the G's I'll be holdin'; picture me rollin'

[Refrain]
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Ooh wee

[2Pac during Refrain]
Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Picture me rollin'
Yeah, nigga!
Aye, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

[Verse 2]
I got keys comin' from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swangin'
Make me wanna start back bangin'
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin' 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
While I'm sippin' on Rémy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sittin' on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin' is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin' a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine, picture me rollin'

[Refrain]
Picture me rollin'
Picture, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me

[Verse 3]
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight sufferin' from lack of havin' paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin'-ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots (so what?)
Checkin' in the park, 'Pac

[Verse 4]
We caught him sleepin'
He didn't peep you niggas creepin'?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, you got the bomb spot
Nigga, time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you can get the females
This crooked shit that we inflictin', gettin' street sales

[Verse 5]
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm cool as a motherfucker, I'ma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swoll
Boss Hogg and this 'Pac nigga, picture us rollin'

[Refrain]
Picture me rollin'
Picture me
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'

[Outro]
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin' roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there
I just could not forget about
I wanna make sure they can see me
Number one on my list: Clinton Correctional Facilities
All you bitch-ass CO's
Can you niggas see me from there?
Ballin' on y'all punk-ass!
Picture me rollin', baby!
Yeah, all them niggas up in them cell blocks
I told y'all niggas when I come home it's on
That's right, nigga, picture me rollin'
Oh, I forgot! The DA
Yeah, that bitch had a lot to talk about in court
Can the ho see me from here?
Can you see me, ho? Picture me rollin'
And all you punk police, can you see me?
Am I clear to you?
Picture me rollin', nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day, you can't stop me

Manute, Pain, Syke, Bogart, Mopreme
It's sad, dog, can you picture us rollin'?
Can you see me, ho?
Is y'all ready for me? We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again

28,Starin’ Through My Rear View,"[Intro]
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Just lookin' back at the world
From another level, you know what I mean? Starin'

[Verse 1]
Multiple gunshots clear the block, the fun stops
Snitches is callin' cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped carin'
Last night two kids shot while the whole block starin'
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me, then they lie to me
Product of a dyin' breed; all my homies tryin' weed
Now the little babies crazed, raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through intermissions, search your heart for a plan
And we turnin' bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview

[Hook]
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers

[Verse 2]
Now you see him, now you don't
Some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
What happened to 'em?
Well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
While you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin' until our dreams come through
Starin' at the world through my rearview

[Verse 3]
Now, I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin' days in this livin' black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section, from years of chin-checkin'
Turn to Smith & Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm gettin' hotter 'cause the world's gettin' colder
Baby, let me hold ya]
Now I know the answers to the question
“Do dreams come true?”
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
I said, now I know the answer
“Do dreams come true?”
Starin' at the world through my rearview

[Hook]
They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly

Nigga, Kadafi say!

[Verse 3]
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for Glocks
'Cause fiends hittin' up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets
Somethin' I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed, bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants
Shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin' all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin' through your rearview

[Outro]
Hahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview
So, since you ain't knowin' what we mean, let me break it better understandin' the world…The world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understandin' on the game, and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
So, now we lookin' at the world from, high watch, behind us
Niggas know what we gotta do]",2Pac,Rap
29,Bomb First (My Second Reply),"[Intro]
In today's music news]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches
Power and money, ridaz and punks
Which side are you on?
*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*
*Encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?
You niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches
A'ight, it's the Raid on cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo shit, bring it!

[Verse 1]
Allow me to introduce first]
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first

[Verse 2]
For so many days, in so many ways we've been duckin' strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nuttin' to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission, sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch, yo I'm dyin' with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a ma'fuckin' Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made ""Paparazzi""
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfuckin' cash, mane
Then what is your motherfuckin' purpose? Narcing service
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first, bitch!

[Bridge]
Biatch! Come on, bring it, down with it!
Then we ride
Come on, bring it
Bomb first when we ride
Hey, get that nigga!

[Verse 3]
Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin' patent leather
Causin' massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin, you're tellin' fairy tales, dunn
""King of New York"" like you the motherfuckin' one?
But I'm from Jers', we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks all my niggas flippin’ chips
Gettin’ rich, even though it's hard
Tryna creep through these halls and brawls without scarred by a revolve'
With no warning signs, ‘cause yo, my man took five
Now I'm the youngin with the 9 ready to put in my time

[Outro]
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, but bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first

Let us pray, my nigga
'Cause we definitely have sinned",2Pac,Rap
30,Wonda Why They Call U Bitch,"[Backing vocals]

[Chorus]
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

[Verse 1]
Look here, Miss Thang, hate to salt your game
But you's a money-hungry woman and you need to change
In the locker room, all the homies do is laugh
High fives ‘cause another nigga played your ass
It was said you were sleezy, even easy
Sleepin' around for what you need, see
It's your thing, and you can shake it how you wanna
Give it up free or make your money on the corner
But don't be bad, play the game, get mad and change
Then you wonder why these motherfuckers call you names
Still lookin' for a way out, and that's okay
I can see you wanna stray, there's a way out
Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school
And as the years pass by, you can show them fools
But you ain't tryin' to hear me ‘cause you're stuck
You're headin' for the bathroom, 'bout to get tossed up
Still lookin' for a rich man, you dug a ditch
Got your legs up tryin' to get rich
I love you like a sister, but you need to switch
And that's why they called you bitch—I betcha!

[Chorus]
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

[Verse 2]
You leave your kids with your mama
‘Cause your headin' for the club
In a skin-tight miniskirt, lookin' for some love
Got them legs wide open while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga 'bout his car
I guess he said he had a Lexus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex?
I pass by, can't hold back tears inside
‘Cause Lord knows, for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonder why they stare and call you slut
It's like your mind don't understand
You don't have to kill your dreams plottin' schemes on a man
Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'
I'm hearin' rumors, so you need to switch
And niggas wouldn't call you bitch—I betcha!

[Chorus]
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

[Verse 3]
I guess times gettin' hard, even harder for you
‘Cause hey now, got a baby on the way now
More money from the county, and thanks to the welfare
You're about to get your hair done
Got a dinner date, can't be late
Trick or treat, sweet thang got another trick to meet
The way he did it it was smooth
Plottin' while he gamin' you so, baby, peep the rules
I should've seen it in the first case, the worst case
I should've never called you back in the first place
I remember back in high school, baby, you was fast
Straight sex when you moved your ass
But now things change, ‘cause you don't look the same
Let the ghetto get the best of you, baby, that's a shame
Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
And finally be at peace
So where your niggas at now? ‘Cause everybody left
They stepped, and left you on your own
See, I loved you like a sister, but you died too quick
And that's why we called you bitch—I betcha!

[Chorus]
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch

[Outro]
Dear Ms. Delores Tucker, keep stressin' me
Fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind
I figured you wanted to know
You know, why we call them hoes bitches
And maybe this might help you understand
It ain't personal, strictly business, baby, strictly business
So If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch",2Pac,Rap
31,Letter 2 My Unborn,"[Intro]
To my unborn child…
To my unborn child
In case I don’t make it
Just remember, Daddy loves you

[Verse 1]
Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Tryna earn every penny that I'm gettin'
I'm reminiscin' to the beginnin' of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My mama was a Panther, loud single parent, but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house
‘Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin' revenge for the agony they did to me
See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure gettin' better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child

[Hook]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

[Verse 2]
Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty for bein' anxious
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin'
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate?
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
Dear Mama, I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child

[Hook]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

[Verse 3]
Dear Lord, can you hear me?
Tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love?
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?
‘Cause bein' black hurts, and even worse if you speak first
Livin' my life as an Outlaw – what could be worse?
‘Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who'm I kiddin'? I'm a thug 'til I die; I'm a rider, mane
Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein' there
Just know your daddy was a soldier]
Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child
To my unborn child…
This letter goes out to my seeds
That I might not get to see ‘cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothin' but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had
‘Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age, you’ll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I’ll see you if there’s a ghetto in Heaven
If there’s a Ghetto Heaven, I’ll be there waitin' for you
Heh heh, take care, run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes there’s confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it all day every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Friends come a dime-a-dozen
Be an individual, work hard
Study, get your mind sharp, trust nobody",2Pac,Rap
32,Unconditional Love,"[Intro]
(What y'all want?)
Unconditional love (no doubt)
Talkin' about the stuff that don't wear off, it don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days, these crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
A motherfucker still love you, still feel you
Still there for you, no matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart with unconditional love

[Verse 1]
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doin' years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God?
So we must ask forgiveness
Ask Mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears fallin' free from my eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama, don't cry, long as we try maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don’t need no welfare and share with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it, the fightin' and the hurtin'
In my room cryin' because I didn't wanna be a burden
Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, with unconditional love

[Chorus]
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

[Verse 2]
Just got the message, you've been callin' all week
Been out here hustlin' on these streets
Ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's all G
We could never be enemies
'Cause you've been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs?
No wonder why when times get hard
'Cause it ain't easy bein' who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make G's eternally
And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation, if I could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
We work somethin' out of nothin'
No pleasure in the sufferin'
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin'
The liquor and the weed, the cussin'
Sendin' love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)

[Chorus]
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

[Verse 3]
I'll probably never understand your ways
With everyday I swear I hear you tryin' to change your ways
While gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Somethin' inside, please let me die, these are strange times
How come I never made it?
Maybe it's the way I played it in my heart
I know one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes, so many vivid pictures
And all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters, 'cause after all the lights and screams nothin' but my dreams matter
Hopin' for better days, maybe a peaceful night
Baby, don't cry, 'cause everything gon' be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry 'bout a thing, baby girl, I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that unconditional love

[Chorus] (repeat to fade)
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love",2Pac,Rap
33,If I Die 2Nite,"[Intro]
A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

[Verse 1]
They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffing weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin'
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, ‘cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes; the game should be sold
I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me
Addicted to drama, so even Mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
I'm duckin' the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin' my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block; what if I die tonight?

[Chorus]
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Fuck it, if I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

[Verse 2]
Polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin' then they done
Calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method
Whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales
Picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversating like they still here; if I die tonight

[Chorus]
If I die tonight
Scare to die nigga, is ya, ha?
If I die tonight
Never fear, never worry
If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

[Verse 3]
Pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the Heaven's, .357's to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin' when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin' these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, I live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading 'Murdered to death', my last breath
Take a look, picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand; if I die tonight

[Chorus]
Nigga, if I die tonight
No fear nigga, never worry
If I die tonight
Bury me a motherfucking G, closed casket fuck it
If I die tonight
You know
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

[Outro]
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder

34,Jada,"U R the omega of my heart
The foundation 4 my conception of Love
When I think of what a black woman should be
Its u that I First think of

U will never fully understand
How Deeply my Heart Feels 4 u

And I'll end up losing u

U bring me 2 climax without sex
And u do it all with regal grace
U r my heart in Human Form

35,Pain,"[Intro]
I couldn't help but notice your pain
My pain?
It runs deep – share it with me!

[Verse 1]
They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labeled as a troublemaker – who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless, rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm 'bout to crash up on the curb ‘cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me – what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family – what else could I do
But be a thug? Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs!
Got my mind on danger, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang-bangers and drive-by's
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young, but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin' back to court, so fuck what you thought!
I'm drinkin' Hennessy, runnin' from my enemies
Will I live to be 23? There's so much pain

[Hook]
Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain

[Verse 2]
Years and years of that rough life
Runnin' crazed and wild as a kid and growin' tough with a knife
And livin' trifed on the regular, buckin' out competitors
See 'em fake a move and chase 'em down like the fuckin' Predator
Get in trouble every day in school, act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin' off for the bitches ‘cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop, pop, pop, and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo, currency kept passin' me by, but I didn't cry, broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke
And now the money's lookin' lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick 'em the game, it's all the same
I kick it back yo, give 'em slack yo
And now they label me the mack yo, people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit
You know you get yo' ass twisted, so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust
So if you owe, nigga, look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game
And my mama always cryin' yo, there's so much pain

[Hook]
Ohhhh…
So tired, so tired...
Ohhhh…
So...so...

[Verse 3]
They got me mobbin' like I'm loc'ed, and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust – I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me
Bust – on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck, ‘cause I ain't lookin' when I'm b-blastin'
I'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessy
And gettin' high, on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why? ‘Cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real, they cannot see, and every day is just a struggle
Steady thuggin' on the streets, and I'll be ballin', loc
Don't let 'em make you worry, keep swingin' at these suckas 'til you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother, I'm touched
Out kickin' dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene, steady muggin' mean, until they kill me
I'll be livin' this life, I know you feel me; there's so much pain

Lookin' for these better days

[Chorus]
Better days, hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Verse 1]
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids
Wanna try now, then lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches 'em, clockin' the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
'Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals, and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried, plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days

[Chorus]
Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Verse 2]
Thinkin' back as an adolescent
Who would've guessed that in my future years I'd be stressin'?
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryna keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin' yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, ‘cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her, but she broke too
And so am I — I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So, we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin', lookin' for them better days (For better days)

[Chorus]
Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

[Verse 3]
Now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart
Locked you up in the pen', and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail
And me, I'm doin' cool
I settled down, had a family, workin' a night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days

[Chorus]
Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey!
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

37,Blasphemy,"[Snipped of a religious TV show]
God has a plan, and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
Through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our savior
And that Christ is returning, someday soon
To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity
For my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God
By accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and savior
Unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy

[Intro]
2Pac, don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed
And I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me
Remember what my pops told me

[Verse 1]
My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle, screamin', ""fuck they feelings!""
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this]
And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my pops told me
Blasphemy!

Nuf for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud

(Remember what my pops told me)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain

[Verse 2]
We pro'ly in Hell, already, our dumb asses not knowin'
Everybody kissin' ass to go to Heaven ain't goin'
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin' devil niggas daily
Plus the media be crucifyin' brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son; nigga, momma a virgin
We got evicted, had to leave the 'burbs
Back in the ghetto, doin' wild shit
Lookin' at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up, deadly
Babylon beware, comin' for the Pharoah's kids
Retaliation, makin' legends off the shit we did
Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waitin' for signs
God comin', she's just takin' her time (haha!)
Livin' by the Nile, while the water flow
I’m contemplatin' plots, wonderin' where the thought’ll go
Brothas gettin' shot, comin' back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)

[Bridge]
And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my poppa told me

[Verse 3]
The preacher want me buried, why? 'Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead? That's eternal fire
Why you got these kids' minds thinkin' that they evil?
While the preacher bein' freaky, you say, ""honor God's people""
Should we cry when the Pope die? My request]
Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holding a bird in a cloud

Using the name of the lord in vain

While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain

Hallowed be Thy name

38,Got My Mind Made Up,"[Verse 1]
You find a MC like me who's strong
Leavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone
I get deadly as Khan, though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand the more power I gain?
That make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck yo' brain
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all-time? When I created rhyme
For the simple fact, when I attack I crush your pride
Our intention to ride, every time, all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride
Breakin' in gas with a .68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, assume to count the bodies

[Verse 2]
So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
So you could be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable, like gas stations
Sorry, I left that ass waitin', no more procrastination
Give up to fate, and get that ass shakin'
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to ""Rhythm Nation"", but thugged out, forgive me, Janet
Who's in control? I'm activatin' your souls
You know the way the games gettin' told
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alizé and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat

[Chorus]
I got my mind made up, come on (Come on)
Get in, get into it (Get on it)
Let it ride (Get with it), tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into it (To it)
Let it ride, tonight's the night

[Verse 3]
Well, I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylac's
For protection, so my fuckin' sack won't collapse (Uh)
'Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays
Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MCs
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe, to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees (Uh)
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocab on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall (Yeah)
Should already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator (Equation)
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To L.A., on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

[Verse 4]
Fuck you losers
While you fake jacks, I make maneuvers
Like Hitler stickin' up **** with German ****
The mister Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial (Yeah)
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket, blaow
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan
Half of my clans repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickels
Man, I stay on point like icicles
Now, who wanna test Tical, then tes-ticles
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

[Verse 5]
Ayo, lyrical gat spittin' the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genital backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor, who? Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men, I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift
Now, you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MCs like ki's
My degrees freeze consecutively, like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake
Bust it, I'm the one pushin' the hearse, in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoke
Choke off this antidote, got you hope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt

Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
These scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes!
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her ""my bitch nigga eater""
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
‘Cause they fear me in the physical form

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on 'em first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screamin', ""Fuck all y'all niggas!"" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass, like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin', ""please""
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died
‘Cause I'm troublesome

Was the rough, rugged and raw]
""Murder, murder, my mind state,"" shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme; the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen ‘cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry?
Tried to warn the little nigga, ""Either stop or die.""
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me ‘cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, ‘cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life

Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
With your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony
Cause I hate it when you act like, you don't know me
I've been stressin' in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go—

[Interlude]
Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go
Throw them the finger!
You know what, baby, it's like—

[Chorus]
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

[Verse 2]
Will I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin', I'm passin' by
Everybody knows I'm ballin', and to God
Gotta keep myself from fallin', but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was—

[Interlude]
Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up!
That's just the thug in me, girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like—

[Chorus]
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

[Verse 3]
A lot of people think it's easy to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was—

[Outro]
Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go
Yo, this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey, y'know?
Throw your fingers up!
You know? They gonna peep this
This how we run game on you
All my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger!
Throw your hands up, give 'em the finger!",2Pac,Rap
41,Never Had a Friend Like Me,"[Intro]
Never!
[Laughs]
You ain't never had a friend like me!
Believe that!
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me!

[Verse 1]
See, at night I watch the sky
I take another breath
I smoke my Newport to the butt
Like it's the last motherfucker left
Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy
Ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fail
Collect calls to my dogs from the county jail
Sending me mail
Heard the block's in the same shape
Ain't nothing changed
Niggas slanging at the same place
The same faces
Suppose to always hate our foes
This lifestyle lives forever
Watch the game unfold
Shedding crocodile tears, just got life plus
And you wonder if these white judges like us
Just stay strong, we'll appeal, nigga, you'll be free
Down with ya to the very end
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How can I be blamed? Forgive me, Lord, I'm insane
In search of fame, won't hurt to change
Following the foot steps of past dealers
Equipped with Ski masks, no witnesses as we blast squealers
And now they feel us in this act of war
More casualties, no survivors
Any man that defies, quickly dies 'cause we riders
In my quest for chips
We wear vests, equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin'
'Cause niggas died over information
How much more can we take
Expect us all to wait
The world ain't ready for us yet so let's make Clinton pay
They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we possess
We had to fight and take it
I think the president is smokin' weed, bumpin' this beat
Makin' a livin' out of my misery
'Til he got a friend like me

[Verse 3]
Promise to visit
I know it's rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail
This is hell
When I was younger
I could picture livin'
In luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison
Fuckin' snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama, he alone die, nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga 25
So now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties, why the fuck should I let you live
When I'm dead inside?
Rapid fire my delivery
I'm bustin' at they whole crew
Nigga, remember me
Hit up my Outlawz set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask
And get to straight coastin'
It's visitin' day at San Quentin
Always there to see your closest roaddog
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me

42,Heartz of Men,"[Intro]
Hey, Suge, what I tell you, nigga?
When I come out of jail, what I was gonna do?
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right?
Heh, watch this!
Hey, Quik, let me see them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars!
Hahahahaha! Yeah, nigga, time to ride!
Grab your bulletproof vest, nigga
'Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now, me and Quik finna show you niggas
What it's like on this side—the real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now, the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now, everybody keep your eyes on the prize
'Cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends, but, in real life, they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life, they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life, those niggas will be snitches
It's a dirty game, y'all
Y'all gotta be careful about who you fuck with
And who you don't fuck with, 'cause the shit get wild, y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, baby
Keep your mind on your riches

[Verse 1]
9-1-1, it's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, every one of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary, niggas scaried and paralyzed
Nothin' more I despise than a liar, cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker, why these devils left me free?
I proceed to make 'em shiver when I deliver
Criminal lyrics from a worldwide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere]
The hearts of men

[Verse 2]
My lyrical verge with so much pain, to some niggas, it hurts
My guns bust, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw, and five-o
Get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G  until the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down, thought I'd rot in jail
Paid bail, well, a nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if you let me
A motherfucker if you do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number, then start again
Don't have no motherfuckin' friends
Nigga, look inside the hearts of men

[Chorus]
In the hearts of men

[Verse 3]
To all my niggas engaged in makin' money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer livin' in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced that this is my year like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is havin' problems, open fire and bomb
I died and came back, I hustle with these lyrics
As if it's a game of crack, thuggin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowin'
Scarred up but still flowin', energized and still goin'
Uhh, can it be fate, that makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous-ass cowards 'cause they evil and fake?
What will it take? Give me that bass line, I'm feelin' bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent, 'cause I've been sent, the hearts of men",2Pac,Rap
43,No More Pain,"[Intro]
Hey, DeVante
Nigga, don't you know we're gonna sow up
Every bitch in the country?
Me and you, up in the same motherfuckin' room, on the same level
This shit here, hahahaha
Please, no more pain
That's right, nigga
Hey, drop that shit, boy

[Verse 1]
My adversaries cry like ho's
Fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin' you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son? Fuck the phony niggas, I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come
Now fire when ready, stay watchin' our figure
Increase speed, make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggas that you run with be on some dumb shit
Trickin' on hoes, I ain't the one, bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick
Have every single bitch that came witchu on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin' you stupid bitches, this is telekinesis
Am I reachin' your brain? Nigga, how can I explain?
How vicious this thug motherfucker came
When I die, I want to be a living legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin' game, with no more pain

[Chorus]
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)

[Verse 2]
Line up my adversaries, blast on sight
And fuck your boyfriend, bitch, I want some ass tonight
You know my steelo
Alizé and Cristal, weed
Sure you heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh?
Plus all you busters is jealous
Pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggas to open fire
I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the cops come runnin'
My Glock's spittin' rounds, niggas fallin' down, clutchin' they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggas on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggas don't die
Can ya hear me? Laced with this game, I know you feel me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a soldier with a brain to teach your whole nation and feelin' no more pain

[Chorus]
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (Yeah, nigga, no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
(What? What, nigga?)
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain (No pain, nigga)
Let's go inside my astral plane (No pain)

[Verse 3]
Bury me that's what they all say
It's time to make a killin', sure to make a million with DeVante
Bitch, I know you want me, what your mouth say?
Now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips
No time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggas from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin', it ain't nothin' we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker 'cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, baptized the public
Now you all thugs, nigga, don't you love it?
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin' so watch the guns bust
You niggas will bleed, fuckin' with me, you'll be deceased
Never restin' in peace, nigga, with no more pain

[Chorus]
I came to bring the pain, hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
I came to bring the pain, hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane

[Outro/Collision]
Hahahahaha, yeah, nigga, yeah! Hahahaha, no more pain
It's just like that, nigga, like that, yeah, no more pain
Motherfuckers can't handle that shit
Much too much for these bitches, no more pain
Feel me, nigga? Feel me?
How you figure you can fuck with me? No more pain
Fully automatic type shit, no more pain
Coward-ass niggas, cowards
Come put your mouth on this pistol, nigga
Come put your mouth on the pistol, no more pain
Close your eyes, nigga, do it
Die in the dark, no more pain
Say Thuuuuuuuug Life, baby
Death Row, so what you motherfuckers do? Hahaha

Hahahaha, yeah, nigga, no more pain
Prison ain't changed me, nigga, it made me worse
Feel me, nigga, hahaha, no more pain
Hey, DeVante, I'm givin' these motherfuckers choices

Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?
Let me come swoop you up

I know you got a man, but he ain't gon' mind if I take you out
(Of course he gon' mind)
Let me take you to lunch, I'll have you back before he even get home, before anybody see
(I can't, he ain't gon' let me
Aww c'mon! Pleeeeeease...
(Nah)
Oh aight – what's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?

[Verse 1]
Ever since I met ya I could peep the pressure
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations – would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love makin'
Got you shakin' when I'm standin' near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's gettin' clearer
All he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone
And find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate – but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me, can you get away?

Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon… Let's go… Can you get away?
Can you get away?

[Hook]
So much pressure in the air (I know, I know)
And I can't get away (Just for a little while love)
I'm not happy here (I know it's hard but, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air
(Let's go man, get up outta there, can you get away?)
And I can't get away (Do you love him?)
I'm not happy here (Do you love that man?)

[Verse 2]
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
Ain't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me
‘Cause they phony
But you was different, I got no need to be suspicious
‘Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'
Now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow
Come see tomorrow
Hopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care – that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste
We can hook up at the store. Can you get away?

[Hook]
So much pressure in the air (I know it is)
And I can't get away (Yeah, you can)
I'm not happy here (You ain't happy, huh? Can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (I know… is he beatin' on you?)
And I can't get away (Did he punch you?)
I'm not happy here (Throwin' you around the house?)

[Verse 3]
I sit here reminiscin' and I hope you listenin'
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
‘Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home – that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker
‘Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows, on who controls will it last?
Before I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere
And even if you stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up, ‘cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
‘Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me, can you get away?

[Hook]
So much pressure in the air (Can't get away why?)
And I can't get away
I'm not happy here
(Let me take you away, all I wanna know, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (Man)
And I can't get away (Course you can get away)
I'm not happy here
(If you really wanted to get away, you could get away)

[Outro]
You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, ya know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't tryin' to put you in a position
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
You need, but now… he ain't even takin' care of you
He beatin' on you and shit; look how you look!
You too motherfuckin' raw to be with that nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
Ya know what I'm sayin'? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin' to Hawaii, seein' the world
Seein' what this world got to offer you
Not goin' to, ya know what I'm sayin'?
The emergency room, gettin' stitches
‘Cause this nigga done got jealous. Don't cry, it's all good

[2Pac and Anya talking again]
Can you take me from here?
Shake that man, get away
Can you take me from here?
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeahhh",2Pac,Rap

God bless the dead and buried, nigga, don't worry
If you see God first, tell him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you representin' the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers caught up in the whirlwind
The other day I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin' shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin', never meant to do time
My epitaph will read ""was the last of G's""
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead

Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin' to hang
I can see 'em in my head – pow!
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin' back in my yearbook
All the years took half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die, will they all shed tears?
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoia got me lookin' in the mirror
Behind me, life without my 9, I'd rather do the time
See, I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
[Fuck the police] and all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail?
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin'
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin'
I keep a gun and never run unless I'm comin' at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead

[Verse 3]
I pray before I go to sleep, ""Dear God!""
Say my grace before I start to eat, 'cause times is hard
So I'm droppin' to my knees, ""Oh why!""
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock-a-bye?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, Uzi weighin' a ton
Niggas terrified of drama from the young gun
Hearin' that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind-blowin' so I'm flowin' goin' crazy
Slipped, forgot the gun, but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
But spunk is what he had, kid, I'd rather attack Big
Now you 'bout to smell the aftermath of what the mag did
Wannabe suckas wanna test, I'm tellin' you, yes
The teflon's 'bout to rip through your fuckin' vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
The spirit Biggy Smallz and the thuggin' clique, yeah

Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow
Readin' love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't receive they mail, best believe we riot
Eatin' Jack-Mack, starin' at the walls of silence
Inside this cage where they capture all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Apologies to my true sisters, far from bitches
Help me raise my Black nation, reparations are due
It's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man's world—and all I heard was

[Chorus]
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone's blind?
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
To let you know that you're not alone

[Bridge]
Only thing they ever did wrong (yes!, yes!) was bein' born black (no doubt), in this white man’s world. All my ghetto motherfuckers, be proud to be black if you proud to have this shit like this, 'cause ain't nobody got it like this (all my little black seeds, born black in the white man's world). All these motherfuckers wanna be like us. They all wanna be like us, to be the have-nots]
Bein' born with less, I must confess, only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
I pass his casket, gently askin', is there a heaven for G's?
My homeboy's doin' life, his baby mama be stressin'
Sheddin' tears when her son finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama, why we live so poor?
Why you cryin'? Heard you late night through my bedroom door
Now, do you love me, mama? Why they keep on callin' me nigga?
Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin' in this jail cell, missin' my block
Hearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishin' they'd stop
Proud to be black, but why we act like we don't love ourselves?
Don't look around, busta, (you sucka!) check yourselves
Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still strugglin' in this white man's world

[Chorus 2]
Who knows what tomorrow brings
(Born black in this white man's world)
In this world where everyone's blind?
(In this white man's world)
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
(In this white man's world)
To let you know that you're not alone

[Collision]
We must fight for brother Mumia
We must fight for brother Mutulu
And we must fight for brother Ruchell Magee
We must fight for brother Geronimo Pratt
We must fight for [?], Zulu, [?]
We must fight for the countless political prisoners
Who are locked up falsely by this white man

[Verse 3]
So, tell me why you changed to choose a new direction
In the blink of an eye?
My time away just made perfection
Did you think I'd die?
Not gon' cry, why should I care?
Like we holdin' onto lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me?
God bless me, please keep my seeds healthy
Makin' all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hopin' they bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells
Just in case they trip in Heaven—ain't no G's in Hell
Sister, sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and Kato
Too much for this cold world to take, ended up bein' fatal
Every woman in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see that we under attack?
I never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama
Hope we make it to better times, in this white man's world

[Chorus]
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone's blind?
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
To let you know that you're not alone

We've been here all this time

We ain't never gon' leave this
We ain't never gon' walk off this planet

Use your brain, use your brain
It ain't them that's killin' us, it's us that's killin' us
It ain't them that's knockin' us off
It's us that's knockin' us off

Be a victim, in this white man's world

Niggas out there jealous 'cause we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate, but they can't fade us though
We be mobbin' through the neighborhood, yeah
With that funky sound (so funky)
We be throwin' down

[Intro]
This goes out to you, playa
You know, you know who you are

[Chorus]
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me

[Verse 1]
Are you confused?
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside the shoes
Of a nigga who don't have a thing to lose?
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a nigga's dreams
How could you do me like that? I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again
And now you let the fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape, it's a fool's fate
Without your word, you're a shell of a man
I lost respect for you, nigga, we can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do? If it was up to you, I'd be dead now
I let the world know, nigga, you a coward
You could never be live until you die
See the motherfuckin' bitch in your eye
Type of nigga, that let the evil of the money trap me
When ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me (holla at me)

[Chorus]
Gotta be ready, can’t let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
So I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

[Verse 2]
Curious, spittin' lyrics on the verge of furious
I'm addicted to currency, nigga, that's why we doin' this
I got shot up, I surprised the niggas the way I got up
And then I hit the studio, it's time to blow the block up
No hesitation, this information got you contemplatin'
Heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
Break him and let him see the face of a mental patient
It's a celebration of my criminal elevation, more participation
I want members across the fifty states
We keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Will I be great, is it my fate to live the life of luxury?
Some niggas bought my tapes, so much jealousy it scares me
So be prepared, 'cause only the strong survive, life isn't fair (fair)
Probably never knew the way it feels to die
So you see, come fuck with me, I give that ass a try
Nigga, holla at me

[Chorus]
Gotta be careful, can’t let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
And now I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

[Verse 3]
I should've saw the signs, I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
So many brothas framed in this dirty game
It's a shame, so much pressure on my brain
Why she blame me?
Secrets in the dark, only her and I know
Now I'm sittin' in the state pen', doin' time slow
Guess she made a bad decision that got me livin'
Just like an animal, I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin' 'cause hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
A cemetery full of motherfuckers not knowin'
Picture my prophecy, I got some attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from the coppers, but never let 'em stop me
'Cause I'm a soldier, hell, ever since I was a little nigga
Havin' fantasies of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid, trust; a no-no
Love is a mystery, fuck the po-po
Holla at me

[Chorus]
So when you see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
A nigga gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

49,Death Around the Corner,"[Intro]
Child]
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the - corner, any day
Tryin to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I'm thinkin' 'bout my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of indo and my mind can't take the stress, I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self; but I see death around the corner

[Hook]

I see death around the corner

(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")

[Verse 2]
I see death around the corner, the pressure's gettin' to me
I no longer trust my homies - them phonies tried to do me
Smokin' too much weed, got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest, under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived, straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas that was buggin'
My homie told me once, don't you trust them other suckers
They front like they your homies but they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who'd care
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
Got homies in my head that done passed away screamin' ""Please!""
Young nigga, make G's
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless, I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner

[Hook]
(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner

I see death around the corner

[Verse 3]
(I was raised) I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kiddy
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household
And drinkin' liquor til' you out cold
And though I'm grown now, nigga it's still on - Pow!
Bustin on them niggas 'til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta be suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless, them bitches'll start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murder me now but see me later man, that's on my pops
I got homies that will hunt you 'til you drop
I hope the Lord can forgive me
I was a G and gettin' high was a way of bein' free
I see death around the corner

(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner

This is for all the real motherfuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die; we all gotta go, y'know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business

You fuckin hump?)
Y'all niggas stop actin' like pussies out there, all right
If any of you..
Are tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like that...
I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night I wanna piss on his ashes!

Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me

Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

6,Back to Back,"[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

[Chorus]
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

[Chorus]
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)",Drake,Rap
7,All Me,"[Intro]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

[Chorus]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then, man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do",Drake,Rap
8,Fake Love,"[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me

I've been down so long, it look like up to me

I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

[Verse 1]
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems
Really you never was solid
No, you can't ""son"" me
You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach
I reach back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake
I don't trust a word you say
How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

[Chorus]
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me

Straight up to my face, straight up to my face

Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)

Look you in the face, and it's just not the same

9,From Time,"[Verse 1]
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause

[Chorus]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?""
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

[Verse 3]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga

If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

[Spoken Intro]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn

I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah, we got it, bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot, but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's, tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil—Jesus, grab the wheel

[Part 2]

[Verse]
Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg",Drake,Rap

Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, ""Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”

Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—

Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
'Cause we—

Story stayed the same through the money and the fame

Wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious

[Verse 1]
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway, and say

[Chorus]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge]
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 2]
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week; I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
""Well, I'm sorry""

Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better

15,HYFR,"[Intro]
Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah

[Verse 1]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all (Damn)
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2]
Uhh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

21,Furthest Thing,"[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya

Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin', girl, and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do

[Verse 1]
These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That, or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

""I love you through everything""
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything
This a ""forever"" thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a ""whatever"" thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle

I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me
This shit is everything
Don't know where we stand
I used to hit you 'bout everything, oh

Are we still good? Are we still good?

Yeah, these days, these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we done?
Who is your replacement?

23,Over My Dead Body,"[Intro]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, ""Why do you worry?""
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1]
I think I killed e'rybody
In the game last year, man, fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
At the strip club, mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
Yeah, I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Chorus]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 2]
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?

[Pre-Chorus]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby

Worst—
Motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'—nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause, man, it's a mission
Tryna fight to the finish just to see, am I finished?

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us

Now you want to roll one
Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not?
Tell me, who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you, bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in

Minus twenty we in Pitfield

I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source

But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here

I don't know why they been lyin' but your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well

I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny
You don't even know 'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl
She been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami to heat up the city
And that's word to Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell

And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, ""Get money and fuck these hoes""
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone

I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?"" I be like ""me, girl""
You be like ""oh, word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Or I was average like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year

There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

[Verse 1]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls
And they end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a pot luck, you need to come with it, don't run from it
Like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it one hundred
Met a lot of girls in my times there
Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year
Man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like, ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin'
'Fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it
For like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath
You're too worried about being the best out""

[Chorus]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

[Verse 2]
Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess""
Nah, fuck that shit
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do
You gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign
That's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment
Telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit
Like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together
We just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down
Pick the pen up or put the pen down?
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen-pal
But we've been down

[Chorus]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Oh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, oh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, oh, oh
(Don't do that—)

[Outro]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care

I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest

A shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-woah, oh, woah)
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says ""I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things""
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place; not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misin-terpret
And taint all the images of your ""Mr. Perfect""
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-woah, oh, woah)
A shot for me (Uh-huh, uh-huh, oh-woah, oh, woah)
A shot for me

Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents

They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy!)

'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day

I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down

What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?

How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Chorus]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass

37,Headlines,"[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)

I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything! Money on my mind!""
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake"", girl don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Outro]
I be yelling out ""Money over everything!""
""Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!""
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know

[Outro Poem]
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better",Drake,Rap

But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
'Cause you got the Batphone and my work line
You should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation

She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)

Got a lot of blood and it's cold

Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna ride, fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back and never on the side, uh

You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me? I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided, tell me how you feel inside

[Chorus 2]
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

Yeah-yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, ""A guarantee""
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy

41,Doing It Wrong,"[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

[Bridge]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too

But I need someone different

So, girl, what you singing for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4

Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows

A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland

Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me
Baby, it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody

How you feel about
Comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights
I know we only fuckin' out of spite 'cause your man don't
Do you right, do you right
I could fuck you so good, then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas
Who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there 'cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life, and this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Chorus]
I, I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me, baby

44,Look What You’ve Done,"[Verse 1]
It’s like ’09 in your basement
And I’m in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn’t ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I’m just like my father
My one button, you push it
Now it's, ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with 17 songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son—man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard
I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, 'cause when it's that real
Is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasn't paid, damn
Boo-hoo, sad story—black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid
But it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all-new, shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, you got to me
Then you’d toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out
Man, you deserve it

[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done

Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk—and he knows how to get in touch with you now, to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in this—in this comfortable place. All I can say, Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together, and the times I used to look after you. And I still have wonderful feelings about that.

45,Do Not Disturb,"[Background]
Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered

[Verse]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary

Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

[Chorus]
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

[Verse 2]
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed

I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 2]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you, instead, they say

[Interlude]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

I know you've been hurt by someone else

In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority

Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?""
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD

You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Oh (Thanks for warning me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

[Chorus]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud

Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh

Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin'
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh

Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water

You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger

And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why

Forever in ink with guess whose name?

You know it's till the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas
Ugh

If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy

They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

Yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos (Dinero!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

[Chorus]
In New York (Ayy, aha) (Uh, yeah)

There's nothin' you can't do (Yeah) (Okay)

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley
Labor Day Parade—rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo—I'm from the Empire State, that's

New York (Yeah), New York (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

[Chorus]
In New York (Ayy, ow) (Uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (Okay)
Now you're in New York (Uh, yeah)

Big lights will inspire you (Okay)

One hand in the air for the big city (Oh)
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty (Oh)
No place in the world that could compare (Nah)
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say

I'ma play the corners where the hustlers be
I told him, ""Please don't die over the neighborhood
That your mama rentin'
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood
That's how you rinse it""
I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin'
I coulda bought a place in DUMBO before it was DUMBO
For like 2 million
That same building today is worth 25 million
Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo

Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice first week release date

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

[Verse 1]
Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome, you make it home""
We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!""
I said]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh

[Verse 2]
I apologize
Our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over; ""What if—""
""You over my shit?""

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh

[Verse 3]
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em

Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!

Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick
See me in shit you never saw

The black Maybach, I'm back inside the boat

I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up ‘cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
""No, he's not around."" Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it—not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

[Verse 2]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah!—That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Ha-ha!)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
‘Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

[Chorus]
—renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
‘Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything! (Anything)
Renegade! (Never been afraid to say)
(What's on my mind at any given time of day)
(‘Cause I'm a) renegade!
(Never been afraid to holler about anything)
Anything? (Anything) Anything!

[Verse 3]
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat
Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[Verse 4]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, ‘cause I'm a muh'fuckin'—

[Chorus]
—renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
‘Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything! (Anything)
Renegade! (Never been afraid to say)
(What's on my mind at any given time of day)
(‘Cause I'm a) renegade!
(Never been afraid to holler about anything)
Anything? (Anything) Anything!

[Chorus]
Renegade! Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
‘Cause I'm a renegade!
Never been afraid to talk about anything
(Anything?) Anything! (Anything)

10,Kill Jay Z,"[Verse]
Kill JAY-Z, they'll never love you
You'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, JAY-Z
Fuck JAY-Z, I mean, you shot your own brother
How can we know if we can trust JAY-Z?
And you know better, nigga, I know you do
But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue
You had no father, you had the armor
But you got a daughter, gotta get softer
Die JAY-Z, this ain't back in the days
You don't need an alibi, JAY-Z
Cry JAY-Z, we know the pain is real
But you can't heal what you never reveal
What's up, JAY-Z? You know you owe the truth
To all the youth that fell in love with JAY-Z
You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him twenty million without blinkin'
He gave you twenty minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
""Fuck wrong with everybody?"" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', ""Finish your breakfast!""
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say
Nigga, never go Eric Benét!
I don't even know what you woulda done
In the future other niggas playin' football with your son
You woulda lost it
13 bottles of Ace of Spade, what it did to Boston
Nah, JAY-Z
Bye, JAY-Z",JAY-Z,Rap

The takeover, the break's over, nigga
God MC—me—Jay-Hova
Hey lil soldier, you ain't ready for war
R.O.C. too strong for y'all
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test
Your chest in the line of fire with your thin-ass vest
You bringing them boys to men, how them boys gonna win?
This is grown man B.I., get you rolled into triage, bi-atch
Your reach ain't long enough, dunny
Your peeps ain't strong enough, fucker
Roc-A-Fella is the army, better yet the navy
Niggas'll kidnap your babies, spit at your lady
We bring knife to fistfight, kill your drama
We kill you motherfucking ants with a sledgehammer
Don't let me do it to you dunny ‘cause I overdo it
So you won't confuse it with just rap music

[Chorus]

(""Watch out! We run New York"")

[Verse 2]
I don't care if you Mobb Deep, I hold triggers to crews
You little fuck, I got money stacks bigger than you
When I was pushing weight back in '88
You was a ballerina, I got the pictures, I seen ya
Then you dropped ""Shook Ones,"" switched your demeanor
Well, we don't believe you, you need more people
Roc-A-Fella students of the game, we passed the class
‘Cause nobody can read you dudes like we do
Don't let 'em gas you like, ""Jigga is ass and won't clap you""
Trust me on this one, I'll detach you
Mind from spirit, body from soul
They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole
No, you're not on my level, get your brakes tweaked
I sold what your whole album sold in my first week
You guys don't want it with Hov
Ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov, no!

I know you miss it, Nas, the (Fame)
But along with celebrity comes 'bout 70 shots to your frame
Nigga, you a (Lame!)
You's the fag model for Karl Kani, Esco ads
Went from Nasty Nas to Esco's trash
Had a spark when you started, but now, you're just garbage (Bitch!)
Fell from top 10 to not mentioned at all
To your bodyguard's ""Oochie Wally"" verse better than yours
(Oochie wally wally, oochie wally wally)
Matter of fact, you had the worst flow on the whole fucking song
But I know]

[Verse 4]
A wise man told me, ""Don't argue with fools""
‘Cause people from a distance can't tell who is who
So stop with that childish shit, nigga, I'm grown
Please leave it alone, don't throw rocks at the throne
Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you
I don't know why your advisers ain't forewarn you
""Please, not Jay, he's not for play""
I don't slack a minute, all that thug rappin' and gimmicks
I will end it, all that yappin' be finished
You are not deep, you made your bed, now sleep
Don't make me expose you to them folks that don't know you
Nigga, I know you well, all the stolen jew-els
Twinkletoes, you're breakin' my heart
You can't fuck with me; go play somewhere, I'm busy
And all you other cats throwin' shots at Jigga
You only get half a bar–fuck y'all niggas!",JAY-Z,Rap
12,Picasso Baby,"[Verse 1]
Uh, I just want a Picasso
In my casa, no, my castle
I'm a hassa, no, I'm an asshole
I'm never satisfied, can't knock my hustle
I want a Rothko, no, I want a brothel
No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
Let's make love on a million
In a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling, uh
All for the love of drug dealing, uh
Marble floors, uh, gold ceilings, uh
Oh, what a feeling
Fuck it, I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of
Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMA
Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma

[Chorus]
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso, baby
Picasso
Picasso, baby
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso, baby
Picasso
Picasso, baby

[Verse 2]
It ain't hard to tell, I'm the new Jean Michel
Surrounded by Warhols, my whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel
I just wanna live life colossal
Leonardo Da Vinci flows
Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes
See me throning at the Met
Vogueing on these niggas, champagne on my breath, yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
'Cause I be going ape at the auction
Oh, what a feeling
Aw, fuck it, I want a trillion
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner
Go 'head, lean on that shit, Blue, you own it, uh

Oh, what a feeling

Oh, what a feeling

Okay, I never stuck my cock in the fox's box, but
Damned if I ain't open Pandora's box
They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas don't stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like, ""Old man, just stop""
I could if I would, but I can't, I'm hot
And you blow, I'm still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth, the cameras pops
Niggas is cool with it 'til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again, got my hands in cuff
I'm like goddamn, enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin, ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things
No sympathy for the king, huh?
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America, this how you made me
Come through with the 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO, I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gon' take for me to go, for you to see?
I'm the modern day Pablo Picasso, baby",JAY-Z,Rap

Turn my vocal up, Guru! (Ha-ya)
Turn the music up too (Ha-ya-ya-ya)

[Verse 1]
Super Bowl goals
My wife in the crib feedin' the kids liquid gold
We in a whole different mode
The kid that used to pitch bricks can't be pigeonholed
I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed
Uh, we gon' reach a billi' first
I told my wife the spiritual shit really work
Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all
Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt
All this old talk left me confused
You'd rather be old rich me or new you?
And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new
Like 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh
Nobody wins when the family feuds
But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute
(Mmmmm) Pretty much
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us
Fuck rap, crack cocaine
Nah, we did that, Black-owned things
Hundred percent Black-owned champagne
And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams
Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, hah
But we ain't get through to you yet, uh
What's better than one billionaire? Two (two)
'Specially if they're from the same hue as you
Y'all stop me when I stop tellin' the truth

[Interlude]
Hahahaha (Ha-ya)
I would say I'm the realest nigga rappin' (Ha-ya)
But that ain't even a statement (Ha-ya)
That's like sayin' I'm the tallest midget (Ha-ya)
Wait, that ain't politically correct, forget it (Ha-ya)
Can I get ""Amen"" from the congregation?
Amen, amen (Ha-ya)
Can I get a ""Amen"" from the congregation?
Amen, amen (Ha-ya)
Ha-ya-ya-ya

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'll fuck up a good thing if you let me
Let me alone, Becky
A man that don't take care his family can't be rich
I'll watch Godfather, I miss that whole shit
My consciousness was Michael's common sense
I missed the karma that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'
Kay losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain
Nobody wins when the family feuds
We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools
I'm tryna fix you
I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official
Y'all think small, I think Biggie
Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies
How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me?
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis
We all lose when the family feuds
What's better than one billionaire? Two

Let this shit knock

I done turned Havana to Atlanta
Guayabera shirts and bandanas
Every time you think they got me I switch the planner
Bulletproof this, radio scanners
(You got scanners, we got scanners)
Balling 'til they ban us
You getting too much bread, they try to jam you
Boy from the hood but got White House clearance
Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all parents
Politicians never did shit for me
Except lie to me, distort history
Wanna give me jail time and a fine
Fine, let me commit a real crime
I might buy a kilo for Chief Keef
Out of spite, I just might flood these streets
Hear the freedom in my speech
Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep
Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free
Except I made millions off it, you fuckin' dweeb
I still own the building, I'm still keeping my seat
Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt
Obama said ""Chill, you gonna get me impeached""
But you don't need this shit anyway, chill with me on the beach

Y'all gon' learn today

[Verse 2]
Uh, y'all must want to start a revolution
You know whenever I'm threatened, I start shooting (Bang!)
Catch a body, head to Houston
I'm in Cuba, I love Cubans
This communist talk is so confusing
When it's from China, the very mic that I'm using
Idiot wind, the Bob Dylan of rap music
You're an idiot, baby, you should become a student
Oh, you gonna learn today
Where the fuck have you been
The world's under new management
The new role model, fuck this Zoolander shit

Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

[Verse 1]
We are, yeah, I said it]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile

Only thing that's on my mind

This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records

[Just Blaze]
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

[Verse 1]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, OH, H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov!
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, OH—not D.O.C
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do it Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homie Strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors (*laughing*)
This ain't a movie, dog (oh shit)

[Interlude]
Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!
And I don't care WHAT you think about me—but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK!

[Verse 2]
Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my ""by any means"" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone

Now, back to our regularly scheduled program, L'Album Noir: The Black Album",JAY-Z,Rap
17,Song Cry,"[Intro]
Picture all the possibilities
Picture all the possibilities
Sounds like a love song
Sounds like a love song
The most incredible, baby
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 1]
Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view ‘cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

[Chorus]
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

[Verse 2]
On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me & My Bitch""
Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', ""Let me see that clip!""
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see—that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fuzzy
And they don't remember that, and I don't remember you

[Chorus]
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
Yeah, I've seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

[Verse 3]
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever

[Chorus]
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I know, I've seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

Smile, you recordin'?

[Verse 1]
Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

[Chorus]
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile
Here's your friendly announcer
Smile

[Verse 2]
Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

[Chorus]
Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends

[Verse 3]
I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile

[Outro]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

[Verse 1]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' about, ""What's the reasons?""
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!
Check em out now, ride!
Ride!
Check em out now, ride!

[Chorus]

Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck

20,Heaven,"[Chorus]
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down

[Verse 1]
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2"", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and

[Chorus]
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down

[Bridge]
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion, losing my religion

[Verse 2]
Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh

[Chorus]
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down

Shawn was on that gospel shit

Shit, stuff a million dollars in the sock drawer
That's a war chest in case you need your chest knocked off
Y'all be talkin' crazy under them IG pictures
So when you get to hell you tell 'em Blanco sent ya
I can't take no threats, I got a set of twins (ah!)
Those were just some words you'll never hear again (uh huh!)
For the final time you don't believe these fools
I've never seen a worker rock so many jewels (never!)
I've never seen the runner with so many cars (never!)
Y'all couldn't stop me, you're not as tough as you say you are
My advice is just don't be too nice to niggas
Just set the price so niggas'll live your life, my nigga
Once upon a time in the projects
Shawn was in flight mode, I bought a Pyrex
I was in fight mode and now it's ""fuck me, mijo""
I was movin' them kilos, help you move your peoples
Sometimes you need your ego, gotta remind these fools
Who they effin' with, and we got FN's too
Before we had A&R's, we had AR's too
We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do
We still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did
Emory passed you niggas and he did a bid
Ty Ty jumped over niggas and he's like 5'6""
Got the heart of a giant, don't you ever forget
Don't you never forget, Jigga got this shit poppin'
I pulled out the pot when we was outta options

Uh, niggas is skippin' leg-day just to run they mouth

I pressed ahead of your team with one finger curled
I'll line you all up with one finger wave
Make niggas weave, niggas is out here fake
Laced front to the back, don't front
Y'all gonna make me wig, I'ma give y'all what you want, uh

You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 3]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)

We made it
We made it

[Verse 1]
The devil, the haters, the bloggers
The papers, the labels, they labeled me
But they can't relate to our struggle, my nigga
We came up from slavery
Apologies go out to all of my fans cause they waited so patiently
This one is for all of the lost and forgotten black angels that prayed for me
A milli, a milli, niggas love me cause I'm ill
The greatest story ever told, niggas in the field
From Solomon to Sambo to Django, it's fact
I'm the Farrakhan of rap and I get it from the wheel
The son of WD, who hung around in the D
Who ran around in the three
The trap gods raised me
Face all on the Sphinx
Story all in the wall of the pyramids
Niggas know the Black God saved me
You can blow the nose off, that won't change it
Obamacare won't heal all that anguish
We came a long way from the bottom of the boat
All praise to the Mahdi, we found our language
Gold necklace, middle finger erected
God tribe of Shabazz stylin' on the record
Lost sons of Muhammad, we wildin' in the wreckage
Asha du illah illaha is the message
All these niggas, I got to fight one
All these devils, I got to strike some
All these rebels just waitin' on the war cry

While these rappers rap about guns they ain't shot
And a bunch of other silly shit that they ain't got

This Ace of Spades look like an Oscar
Black tux, look like a mobster
Don't make me RRRRAA yah, nigga watch your tone
I come to court with black boxers on
Y'all hella jealous of my melatonin
I could black out at any given moment
I'm God, G is the seventh letter made
So when my arms and feet shackled I still get paid
All praises due
I'm ready to chase the Yakub back into caves
These are the last days, but do I seem fazed?
Showed up to the last supper in some brand new J's
I'm the true and livin', book of Hov
New religion, 8th wonder of the world, alien, superstition
You're blind, baby
Blind to the fact of who you are maybe
My bloodline's crazy
Kings and queens and Michael Jordan rings

See my name come across on CNN
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again

Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of they history

If Fear is your only God
Get y'all to fear me is my only job
Crown, crown

[Verse 2]
Bulletproof glass, glass roof like the Pope
Bulletproof love, niggas down since the yolk
Bitch asked if I was God, fuck I'm supposed to say? No?
You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T
You already know what I could do with the coke
Dropped it in the water, made it disappear
I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope
I make my roof get ghost, bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold
All the shit I did, I wasn't supposed to live, Hallelujah Hov
Wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able
Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead
Best friends become ya enemies, niggas' knives are double-edged

[Chorus]
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of they history",JAY-Z,Rap

""Ladies and gentlemen
Let's put our hands together for this dynasty!
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
To the 8th wonder of the world!
The flow of the century, always timeless]
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't-born-hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof! —Vamoose, son of a bitch!

[Chorus]

Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let them know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk mo' bucks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail]

29,Young Forever,"[Intro]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

[Chorus]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 2]
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

[Chorus]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 3]
Just let it run..
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young",JAY-Z,Rap

[Verse 1]
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
'Cause when they're sayin' too much
You know they're tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right, it's wicked – that's life, I live it
Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins, ends
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils

We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin'
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know she's wishin' we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be; in time
I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils

My flesh no nigga could test, my soul is possessed
By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist got me doin' sticks
Like, ""Homie, you don't know me
But the whole world owe me, strip!""
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off – Momma, forgive me
I can't be held accountable, D'evils beatin' me down, boo
Got me runnin' with guys, makin' G's, tellin' lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I'm givin' lead showers
Stop screamin', you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils

My chain already heavy, don't let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush, Confetti on my fur
Turn right in Red Hook, niggas heavy on the curb

Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came through Pasadena in the low-low
Just to show respect to the cholos
Feelin' like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
I just want a shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murdered Malcolm, gave Cassius the shakes
Wait, tell them rumble young man rumble
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know I'm gon' shine like a trillion watts
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks
Sendin' light out to Compton and the hundred blocks

Got strip clubs feeling like Oxford, I swear
Teacher-teacher, I'm trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game, those the Spike Lees
You front row everywhere, you in the H.O.V.'s
Jordan 1's and dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?

It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked

I prayed so hard it was the last time
Your mama said that you danced for her
Did you wiggle your hands for her?

Glory! Sorry
Everything that I prayed for
God's gift, I wish I woulda prayed more
God makes no mistakes, I made a few
Rough sledding here and there, but I made it through
I wreak havoc on the world

And Mama woke up the next day and shot her album package
Last time the miscarriage was so tragic
We was afraid you'd disappear, but nah, baby, you magic (Voilà!)
So there you have it, shit happens
Just make sure the plane you on is bigger than your carry-on baggage
Everybody go through stuff
Life is a gift, love, open it up

You're the child of my destiny
You're my child with the child from Destiny's Child

Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Them-a-murder me, so I gotta murder them first
Emergency, doctors performing procedures

""Vengeance is mine"" sayeth the Lord, you said it better than all
Leave niggas on death's door, breathing on
Respirators for killing my best boy, haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz, flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumping ""Brown Sugar"" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles, like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature, ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithe, being good Catholics, I'm coming

Yes, this is holy war, I wet y'all all with the holy water
Spray from the Heckler-Koch automatic

I pour out a little Louis, 'till I head above
Yessir, and when I perish, the meek shall inherit the Earth
'til that time, it's on and popping, church
Like Don Bishop, the fifth or palm cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
Please I leave you in somebody's cathedral for stunting like Evel Knievel
I let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk, the more you irking us
The more you gon' need memorial services
The Black Album, second verse, is like
Devil's pie, save some dessert for us

Man, I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They won't be happy 'til somebody die
Oh man, I gotta get my soul right
'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems it's alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this Earth
(Let me get serious for y'all, one second)

I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bob's killer
Asking him ""why?"" as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel ya
So, curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass, reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are, Bobalob
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude, please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning, thanks again",JAY-Z,Rap

I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths

You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
'Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep

Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you

He told me his wishes before he died

They eyes hide, they eyes high

These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy has ""Slave"" on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't ""big bro"" me, don't ""Big Homie""
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful

Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you

I've been ready for this for real
Hopin' I can touch what I see
'Cause I've been ready for you, for real

Look, you've done enough
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?

Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest one representin' BK to the fullest
Bastards duckin' when Hov be buckin'
Chicken-heads be cluckin'

[Verse 1]
Uhh, back when ratchet was a ratchet and a vixen was a vixen
And Jam Master Jay was alive I-I, I was mixin'
Cookin' coke in the kitchen
Back when Rodman was a Piston
Mike was losin' to Isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one
Gave birth to my verbal imagination
Assume a virtue if you have not
Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet
""Lord, we know who we are
Yet we know not what we may be""
So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy
I'm from Marcy Houses, where the boys die by the thousand
Back when Pam was on Martin
Yeah, that's where it all started
When Denzel was blottin' carpet, I'll pack a… nine millimeter
When Slick Rick made ""Mona Lisa""
When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day, I had divas, y'all
Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus? Nah
Pregnant pause, give you some second thoughts
There's room on the bandwagon, don't abort
Marcy me

[Verse 2]
Marcy me
Streets is my artery, the vein of my existence
I'm the Gotham City heartbeat
I, started in lobbies, now parley with Saudis
I'ma, Sufi to goofies, I could prolly speak Farsi
That's poetry, reek of coca leaf in my past
Came through the bushes smellin' like roses
I need a trophy just for that
Old Brooklyn, not this new shit, shit feel like a spoof
Fat laces in your shoe, I'm talkin' bustin' off the roof, uh
Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke
Y'all flirtin' with death, I be winkin' through the scope
Shout out to all the murderers turned murals
Plural, fuck the Federal Bureau
Shout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle
All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile
Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes
Thus concludin' my concerto
Marcy me

[Outro]
Must be in the air
Oh, can't walk away, I know, I know
Just the way I'm raised
I know, I know, I know
Oh Marcy, Marcy me
Just the way I am always gonna be
I ain't gonna change, no
Marcy, Marcy me, just the way I am
I ain't gonna change, no
I ain't gonna change, no
Couldn't change me if I wanted to
You couldn't change me if you wanted to

“I work and work 'til I'm half-dead and I hear people saying
""She's getting old,"" and what do I get? A daughter
Who cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her
As she cares about ME!”

[Verse 1]
Let's do this for these babies
Mercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres
Blatantly ballin' on HD
Y'all need to step up y'all AV
Life changed again I was already taking off
My flight changed again
Slight change of winds
It's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
Baby need Pampers
Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block
I thought my daddy didn't love me
My baby getting chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww, isn't she lovely?
Now I'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly
And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody, I need a joint right now
Just the thought alone fucks with me

[Hook]
High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest

[Interlude]
""Don't fuck with me fellas. This ain't my first time at the rodeo.""

[Verse 2]
I dream filthy (My mom and pops)
Mixed me with Jamaican (Rum and whiskey, what a set off)
And I know I'm not perfect baby
I done been through so much trauma, it gonna be hard to reverse it
With some doctors and some nurses maybe
Teach me on how to treat a lady, open doors on the 'Cedes
This relationship shit is complicated
All I know if we ain't speaking everyday, I fucking hate it
I don't wanna duplicate it
I seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin' crazy
And I got that nigga blood in me
I got his ego and his temper, all is missing is the drugs in me

High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest

""No... wire... hangers... EVER!""

[Verse 3]
Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother
I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
Baby with no daddy want no momma drama
I just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer
Out in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower
And a Ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us
For the beauty that you be Blue be
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears
Cheer up, why can't you just be happy
Without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared
But in life and death if I ain't here

High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor

Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

[Intro]
Rock on, Roc-A-Fella y'all
The saga continues (What the fuck?)

[Verse 1]
Ahh, who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce?
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous, all the et ceteras
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck 'em, they hate a nigga lovin' his life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life
Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up
On the uptown high block, he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin', this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said ""pray for me""
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothin' but time
I had near brushes, not to mention
Three shots, close range, never touched me, divine intervention
Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ty-Ty
Down in Nevada, haha, poppa, word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
Partner, I'm still spendin' money from '88, what?

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)

Geyeah, know what?
I'll make, you and your wack mans fold like bad hands
Roll like Monopoly, advance
You're coppin' me like white crystal
I gross the most at the end of the fiscal year than these niggas can wish to
The dead presidential candidate
With the sprinkles and the Presidential, ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime flees my mind
All sneak thieves and player haters can shine
But until then, I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shinin' brilliant
I'll tell you half the story; the rest, you fill it in
Long as the villain win
I spend Japan yen, attend major events
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin'
J-A-Y hyphen, controllin', manipulatin'
I got a good life, man, pounds and pence
'Nough dollars make sense, while you ride the bench
Catch me swingin' for the fence
Dead presidents, ya know? Uh-huh

Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (Whose-)

40,Moment of Clarity,"[Intro]
Woo! Geah, geah (Young) geah
Uhh, turn the music up, turn the lights down
I'm in my zone

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 1]
Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
Put that in the eggshell, standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church, pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like, ""Damn, that man's face is just like my face""
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homie, you got caught
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in Heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 2]
Music business hate me ‘cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it, yet they all yell ""holla""
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill' – I ain't been rhyming like Common since (Whoo)
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception! Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them (rims, that is)

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 3]
My homie Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall
‘Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See, in my inner circle, all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, ‘cause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago, prepared the flow
Prepared for war, I should fear no man
You don't hear me though, these words ain't just 'pared to go
In one ear, out the other ear, no!
Yo, my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars will scab
What, you gonna box me, homie? I can dodge a jab
Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK, nigga, holla back!

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out

World can't hold me, too much ambition
Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen

Uhh, Big Pimpin' in the house now
Bought the land, tore the muh'fuckin house down
Bought the car, tore the muh'fuckin roof off
Ride clean, I don't never take the shoes off
Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off
Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard
Navigation on, tryin' to find my next thrill
Feelin' myself, I don't even need a X pill
Can't chill but my neck will
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal
Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets
Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin' in the projects
Had her out in Bed-Stuy, chillin' on the steps
Drinkin' quarter waters, I gotta be the best

Fake Dracos all in the videos
We show 'em, we shoot 'em in my city though
I don't post no threats on the Internet
I just pose a threat, blame Lenny S for that

And y'all niggas is 'posed to be trill?
That's real talk when you behind on your taxes
And you pawned all your chains
And they run off with your masters
And took it to Beverly Hills while we in Calabasas
And my head is scratchin' 'cause that shit is backwards

Sure I do

[Verse 1]
I'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em and
Bullets'll follow 'em and
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street, holmes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones, your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip, you are now gone
Welcome to Hell, where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come, you better return 'em
All scars, we earn 'em
All cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin' out the back of vans
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it
Was clappin' them flamers before I became famous
For playin' me, y'all shall forever remain nameless

I am Hov
You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—

I tell you the difference between me and them
They tryin' to get they ones, I'm tryin' to get them M's

I came into this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact, from grindin' G-packs
Put this shit in motion, ain't no rewindin' me back
Could make 40 off a brick, but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov' would sell clothin'
Not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them, hah
I smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin' at one smart black boy
Mama ain't raised no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth, motherfucker

I am a hustler, baby, I'll sell water to a whale

[Verse 1]
I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so, make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one

Lose, one, let go to get one
Get, one, lose some to win some (you lost one)

Sorry, I'm a champion
You lost one

I don't think it's meant to be, B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth
To be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

[Chorus]
Lose, one, let go to get one
Get, one, lose some to win some (oh yeah, she lost one)
Story of a champion
Sorry I'm a champion
You lost one

[Verse 3]
My nephew died in the car I bought
So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like havin' your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waitin' for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it

After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread

Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'

With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations

When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore

[Interlude]
Owww, it's star time
This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage
Say ""Hova!"" – c'mon, say it!
Are y'all out there? [crowd chants ""HO-VA! HO-VA!""]
C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about
They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!

[Break]
I like the way this one feel
It's so motherfuckin' soulful, man!
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Yeah [crowd still chanting] okay

[Verse 3]
So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2
And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two
You wanted to gain attention, new dudes
I can get you BET – and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me]

I seen Mase do it, I seen 'Ye do it
'X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it; clap for him!
But I’m the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
50 came through like hurricanes do
I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did ""A Milli,"" 50 did a milli
'Ye too, but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on ""Renegade,"" fucking awesome
Applaud him!

Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down
The Face Mob kept it ghetto for the H-town
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches
Drake's up next, see what he do with it
Rule had a run, couple movie parts
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y’all remind me of us in early '92
Outkast landed, 3-thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run, standing ovay, ayyy

Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day, a star is born

And I am one of one
Can’t you see just how long my run?
My reign, Lulu's son-shine
Been a star since I was duckin' one-time
One time, give it up for him
December 4th, a star was born
Clap for him! He went from moving that corner
To this corner office, it's so enormous
Hey, Prez Carter
Watch them get they Monica on all day
Hey, got so many different monikers but only one Jay
They come, they go, some real, some faux
Some friends, some hoes
But, no, I goes nowhere, this Hov'

Every day a star is born

Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey

[Verse 4]
And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad day light, go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal, a real lifesaver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada
I chill now, cop a little ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick, thought he wrote the rap for him—no, sir!
The flow cold as the shoulders
Of gold-digging hoes when a broke nigga 'proaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in, and clap for 'em!

Every day, a star is born (And you say New York City!)

First the Fat Boys break up—now every day I wake up;
Somebody got a problem with Hov
What's up? You niggas all fed up ‘cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young fucks spittin' at me, young rappers gettin' at me
My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"" – gotta move carefully
‘Cause faggots hate when you gettin' money like athletes
Youngins ice-grillin' me — oh, you not feelin' me?
Fine, it cost you nothin', pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for frontin'
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs
Damn, little mans, I'm just tryin' do me
If the record's two mil I'm just tryin' move three
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck, I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas, I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waitin' in the wing, but I'm doin' my thing
Where's the love?

[Hook]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town

[Verse 2]
And then the Fugees gonna break up
Now everyday I wake up, somebody got somethin' to say
What's all the fuckin' fussin' for?
Because I'm grubbin' more and I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball
Now, I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar
Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in '96 that I came to take this shit
And I did handle my biz, I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham, but the only thing runnin' is numbers, fam
Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love?

[Hook]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town

[Verse 3]
Fuck; then Richard Pryor gon' and burn up
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin' to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female trait
What, you mad ‘cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Hehehe, and more baggies — why you all aggie?
Nigga, respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit; where's the love?
Where's the love?

And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but, no bitches
Watch how I'm walkin', 'cause even the thoroughest niggas be NARC'in
Tryin' to strike a bargain, hopin' that they might get pardoned
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles

""I want money like Cosby"" – who wouldn't?

You in the streets, nigga, make your moves, get your mail
Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail
Niggas'll roast a L, but scared to throw your toast, well
I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
There's heaven, then there's hell, niggas
One day you're cruisin' in your 7, next day, you're sweatin', forgettin' your lies

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!

[Chorus]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck!""
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I

Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?

Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Refrain]
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Verse 2]
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted
As soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

[Chorus]
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?

(Pool full of Kendrick's lies in it)
Aw man… where is she takin' me?
Where is she takin' me?
(Pool full of liquor ima die in it)

[Verse 3]
All I, All I, All I, All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Outro]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-Dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight, man, that nigga ain't trippin'
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ****'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there
We gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, ayy, I see somebody
[Car door opens and gunshots are fired]
Aha! Got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?
L****, you good?
Yeah, blood, I'm good – Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say somethin' – Dave?

3,DNA.,"[Verse 1]
I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

[Bridge]
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life

This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

[Verse 2]
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dog, like 101

Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll aks again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera

6,"Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe","[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

[Hook]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Chorus]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Pre-Chorus]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages

Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal

[Chorus]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music

7,Poetic Justice,"[Intro]
Every second, every minute
Man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
I'm talkin' about dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1]
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit
Uh, and I know your taste is
A little bit, hmm, high maintenance
Uh, everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And y'all curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
'Less I write it down for real, P.S

[Chorus]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 2]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these one-off vacations you've been takin'
Clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Chorus]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

[Verse 3]
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it? I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it
Uh-huh, that's your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, P.S

[Chorus]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus 1]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

[Chorus 1]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 1]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 2]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk

Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?

Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it?

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Verse 1]
Goddamn I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix
My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'—

I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum and posin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—

So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

They say, ""K, you goin' marry mines.""
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! No way
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! Okay
I'm never livin' life confined

I'm fucked up, homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers",Kendrick Lamar,Rap
12,The Blacker the Berry,"[Intro]
Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

[Bridge]
Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Chorus]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 2]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Chorus]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 3]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots]

[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself]
Promise that you will sing about me

""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!""

[Verse 1]
Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 3]
How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

[Verse 4]
What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works.""

[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner.""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins.""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord.""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe you raised Him from the dead.""
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life.""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior.""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life.""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)

I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know

[Chorus]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

[Verse 2]
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah
They never been ready, yeah, I know, yeah, know, yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow, yeah, the flow, yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option

[Chorus]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

[Bridge]
Damned if I do, if I don't (Yuh)
Goddamn us all if you won't (Yuh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way

[Verse 3]
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists

[Chorus]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element",Kendrick Lamar,Rap

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'm geeked and I’m fired up (Fired, fire)

Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (Die for, fire)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (I’m on fire)

All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 1]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millennium
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

[Verse 2]
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it’s EDM

Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I’m a natural, I'm alright

[Verse 3]
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I’m a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (Yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (Yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

All I want is, all I want is

With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Verse 4]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Verse 5]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

[Pre-Chorus]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just to get high up (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is

Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(Ah, one two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
I done been through a whole lot (Kendrick Lamar!)
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie (Make some noise, brother!)
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

[Chorus]
And (I love myself)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, huh

[Verse 1]
They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace (Oh, yeah)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile-

[Chorus]
And (I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated—
All ya'll come to the front, ya'll come up to the front
(I love myself)
Baby what about you? Come on

[Verse 2]
(Crazy, what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

[Chorus]
(I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police

Huh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy

[Verse 3]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right (Oh no)
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body...

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""
He said, ""Think about what you saying: ""Fuck niggas""
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats""
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time

17,A.D.H.D.,"[Intro]
Uh-uh, fuck that (fuck that)

[Chorus]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Verse 1]
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section.80
And you feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party, trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Woah, woah-woah
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Woah, woah-woah, woah, woah-woah
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)

[Verse 2]
And then she started…
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
""Beg your pardon?"" ""Oh, I rap, baby.""
""How old are you?"", She say 22, I say 23
""Okay, then we are crack babies.""
""Damn, why you say that?"" She said, ""Where my drink at?""
""I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax.""
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, ""Read between the lines.""
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown her body and I know
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me, then looked at it
And then she grabbed it, then she said, ""Get it understood.""
""You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D crazy.""

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that

[Verse 3]
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

[Verse 4]
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

[Bridge 2]
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

[Outro]
Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you

[Chorus 1]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan—
(one two, one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 1]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Verse 1]
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 2]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that—

[Verse 2]
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest?
Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say;

[Refrain 2]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 3]
The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga—

[Verse 3]
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all
It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh

[Refrain 3]
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us ""Billie Jean,"" you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

[Chorus 4]
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga

[Spoken Outro]
""I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man
Maybe I’m just another nigga”

Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call it ""Another Nigga"" but, it ain’t really a poem
I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that, what the ground represent?

The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That’s how I see it, my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
Right
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
Right
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...
There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?

Aight so let me ask you this then
Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?

I see myself as a natural born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin’, I took the opportunities
I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
I changed everything, I realized my destiny
In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying?
I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people
Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying?
I made millions for the record companies
I made millions for these movie companies
Now I make millions for, for us

And through your different avenues of success
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true""
Right
You know what I’m saying?
And it was happening to me for a reason
You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
So it’s no problem, you know
I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know
I’m finna go straight through

Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance
And not only me but, it goes down my family tree
You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back

Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
""We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win
And I wanna lay it all down""

In this country, a black man only have like
5 years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man, in this country
And you don’t wanna fight no more
And if you don’t believe me, you can look around
You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers

That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that
There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?

I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
For real, I don’t think America know that
I think America think we was just playing
And it’s gonna be some more playing but
It ain’t gonna be no playing
It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying?
It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen

That’s crazy, man, in my opinion
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic
And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out
Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes

Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn

I wanted to read one last thing to you
It’s actually something a good friend had wrote
Describing my world, it says]",Kendrick Lamar,Rap
20,Wesley’s Theory,"[Additional production by Sounwave & Thundercat]

[Sample]
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy
Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?

[Intro]
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Chorus]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

[Verse 1]
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Chunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that

[Refrain]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
(Everybody get out)

[Chorus]
At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?

[Break]
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker

[Verse 2]
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[Bridge]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Refrain]
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

[Chorus]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Verse 1]
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need ya!
The world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear—

[Chorus]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated

[Post-Chorus]
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too

[Break]
(Loving you ain't really complicated)
""Housekeeping, housekeeping""
(What I got to do to get to you?)
""¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!""

""¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!""

[Verse 2]
Are you the reason why mom and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed,"" you ain't try

[Break]
*Sniffling*

[Verse 3]
I know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk *gulping*
I cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world
About that shit you thinkin' and that time you *gulping*, I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago
You should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if these mirrors could talk it'd say, ""You gotta go""
And if I told your secrets the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness",Kendrick Lamar,Rap
22,The Heart Part 4,"[Chorus]
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won’t tell the truth 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship
Candy-coated, my day shift's
Been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
Pi equals three-fourteen
The devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing
Wait up, lampin' in Jamaica
The clouds turnin', my thoughts turnin’
Burnin’ castor oil, yo I been determined to make an earnin'
This seed in this soil is classified
I’m satisfied when I strategize my kid's future
I ain't sanctified enough to say that I won't shoot ya
I done vandalized the industry full circuit
The earthiest slash thirstiest nigga you know versus this
Scum of a land that transcend two surfaces
The richer the poorer, the bigger the picture
The more blood pours, but—

[Chorus]
Don’t tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you
Don't tell a lie on me
I won't tell the truth 'bout you

[Verse 2]
My fans can't wait for me to son ya punk-ass
And crush ya whole lil' shit
I'll Big Pun ya punk-ass, you a scared lil' bitch
Tiptoein' around my name, nigga, you lame
And when I get at you, homie
Don't you just tell me you was just playin'
Oh, I was just playin', K-Dot
C'mon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro
Shut the fuck up, you sound like the last nigga I know
Might end up like the last nigga I know
Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know
I put my foot on the gas, head on the floor
Hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, I'm on a roll
Yellin', ""One, two, three, four, five
I am the greatest rapper alive""
So damn great, motherfucker, I've died
What you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
House on the hill, house on the beach, nigga (facts)
A condo in Compton, I'm still in reach, nigga (facts)
I'm fresh out the water, I'm 'bout to breach, nigga
The five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears
Mo' bars, no peers, no scars, no fear—fuck y'all, sincere
I heard the whispers, I curved the whispers
You know what the risk is
Earthed in ditches, your body revertin' to stiffness
The whole world gone mad
Bodies is addin' up, market's about to crash
Niggas is fake rich, bitches is fake bad
Blacks that act white, whites that do the dab
Donald Trump is a chump
Know how we feel, punk—tell him that God comin'
And Russia need a replay button, y'all up to somethin'
Electorial votes look like memorial votes
But America's truth ain't ignorin' the votes
It's blasphemy, how many gon' blast for me?
I prophesized on my last song, you laughed at me
But when the shit get brackin', don't you ask for me
How many leaders gon' tell you the truth after me?
G Malone, big bro, kudos to him
I was two O's from a M, tryna be big as Em
Thirty millions later, my future favors
The legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
Salmon and capers, fame and lawsuits
You lookin' at me in Chucks, I'm lookin' at y'all suits
Me and Top Dawg playin' rock-paper-scissors in court
A real hustler lose money just to go get some more
I said it's like that, dropped one classic, came right back
'Nother classic, right back
My next album, the whole industry on a ice pack
With TOC, you see the flames
In my E-Y-E's—it's not a game
And the whole world is goin' mad, daddy, it's sad, daddy
My only advice? Go and get you a bag, daddy
Lee Baca on trial tryna portray a boxer
Beatin' up on my niggas while the CO's watch him
Tables turned, lesson learned, my best look
You jumped sides on me, now you 'bout to meet Westbrook
Go celebrate with your team and let victory vouch you
Just know, the next game played I might slap the shit out you
Technical foul, I'm flagrant, I'm foul
They throwin' me out, you throw in the towel
Look at the crowd, they— (Naw, I don't like that)
Look at my smile, I'm smirkin'
Calm but urgent (That ain't the style, fuck!)
So many verses, you live in denial (Fuck!)
So many verses, I never run out (What?)
You makin' him nervous, the music is loud
Ho, JAY-Z Hall of Fame, sit yo punk-ass down!
(Sit yo punk-ass down)
So that means you ain't bigger than rapping (What else?)
So that means no more playin' the back scenes (What else?)
My spot is solidified if you ask me (What else?)
My name is identified as ""That King""
I'll let y'all worry about a list, I'm on some other shit
A difference between accomplishments and astonishments
You know what time it is, ante up, this is in forever
Y'all got 'til April the 7th to get y'all shit together

Love's gonna get you killed

[Chorus]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Verse 1]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe I wasn’t there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there

[Verse 2]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

[Chorus]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care

Told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans, ya bitch

[Chorus]
Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ah
Drank until I can't no mo', ay-ay-ay-ah
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't askin' for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ah
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I'm with the homies right now
And Momma used to say (Say, say, say, say)

One day it's gon' burn you out, out, out
One day it's gon' burn you out (You, you, you, you, you, you)
One day it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

[Part II]

[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies

[Hook 1]
Yeah, nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head, nigga!
Me and the homies
Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more
Me and the homies
I ride for my mothafuckin' niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in
Me and the homies
Matter of fact, I hop out that mothafucka
And be like ""doo-doo-doo-doot, doo-doo-doo-doo-doot!”

[Verse 2]
It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies

[Hook 2]
(Just ridin', just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin' a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin', really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin', just ridin', just ridin')

[Verse 3]
Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want

Ayy, ayy, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ayy, nigga, I think there's somebody in this room!

I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD's, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called]
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, fo' real doe
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga— what's that Jeezy song say, nigga?
""Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!""
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there
I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man, you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan, luv
We gon' use the kickback as a alibi, wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park
'Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he's not gon' do
Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should meet up around 12
I'm tryna fuck on somethin' too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down!
Nigga, you ain't doin' shit tonight!
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the mothafuckin' car!

The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect

26,Rigamortis,"[Intro]
Alright, here we go, third take
Real quick, Ali, mm

[Chorus]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yessir (Amen!) Church
(He dead!) I killed him (Amen!) Bitch

[Verse 1]
And this is rigor mortis, and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus; the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead! Amen!) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrities, this is studio felony
Ferragami, so many, and cool enough for the '70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch you been living in debt with me
Dead 'em all, and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
That say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do

[Chorus]
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I killed him
(He dead!) Hmh, hmh, hm (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Verse 2]
I rapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster?
Your hypocritesque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
I'm persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of y'all fucks never could hassle me
And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see

[Chorus]
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead!) Yup-yup (Amen!) I know
(He dead!) For sure (Amen!) Amen",Kendrick Lamar,Rap
27,HiiiPoWeR,"[Intro]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something, or die in the morning
Section.80, HiiiPoWeR

[Verse 1]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Verse 2]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on the field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Bridge]
Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na

[Verse 3]
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

28,How Much a Dollar Cost,"[Verse 1]
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, ""Beat it""
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more""
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?

[Chorus]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

[Verse 2]
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
""Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need""
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?

[Chorus]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

[Verse 3]
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God""

[Outro]
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what it's all meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs

29,Black Friday,"[Intro]
Dick hard like rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo

[Verse]
The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from 1980 somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
I’m in the White House going all out
Bumping College Dropout, God bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
The story of your life here
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
Whoa
Burnin’ my leather-
(Nah I’m just fuckin’ wit cha)

30,These Walls,"[Directed by Colin Tilley & The Little Homies]

[Poem]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

[Intro]
(Woman moaning)
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk-
Sex

[Verse 1]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you (Ah, come on)
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey), (Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
She plays, only when you tell her no

[Chorus]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 2]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

[Chorus]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 3]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss 'em
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

[Chorus]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to Sing About Me
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)

[Poem]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression

31,Hood Politics,"[Intro]
K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Every time I call, it's going to voicemail
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!

[Chorus]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later, going hard like we used to, on the dead homies
On the dead homies

[Verse 1]
I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
Our lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now, here, if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop
Flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes, ""Sherm sticks, burn this""
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50-nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Co's, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

[Chorus]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later, going hard like we used to, on the dead homies
On the dead homies

[Verse 2]
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, ""The enemies done cliqued up""
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everything is everything, it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas' names on paper—you snitched all summer
Streets don’t fail me now
They tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress
Set-trippin’ all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-icans
Red state versus a blue state—which one you governin'?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, ""What it do?""

[Interlude]
Obama say, ""What it do?""
Obama say, ""What it do?""
Obama say, ""What it do?""

[Chorus]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo-boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo-boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo-boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later, going hard like we used to, on the dead homies
On the dead homies

[Verse 3]
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who Black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah, homie, we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the Coast involved, then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said, ""It's funny how one verse could fuck up the game""

[Chorus]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo

[Poem]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war
Back in the city
I was entering a new one",Kendrick Lamar,Rap

I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement

The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended

Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'

Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

[Outro]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'",Kendrick Lamar,Rap

(Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you’ve taught me to
Smokin' weed with you
'Cause you’ve taught me to)

[Verse 1]
Every morning when I wake up, uh
Money on my mind, good time to get caked up, uh
Sunshine coming through my blinds, I’m living, but
Really though, it's never enough, ten million, that's a must
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive
Down the block and you look outside
H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby, come and lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

[Pre-Chorus]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'
But nothing like my hometown, I'm forever livin'

[Chorus]
Women, weed and weather
They come for women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever? Come and play
Wh-what more can I say? W-welcome to LA

[Verse 2]
Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
Three W's only for a three-day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
""Ribbon In The Sky"" on the radio 'cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
'Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know I'm priority, order me
Hennessy and, for my niggas, OG Killa
Call it Jason Voorhees, boy, he's on his job
Boy, he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life, controlling my price?
No way, hell no, uh-uh
If I'm wrong, I don't wanna be right
We want to be on to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off

[Pre-Chorus]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas, I be screwed up, Chi-Town, I be really pimpin'

[Verse 3]
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling
Anything out by that ocean
I'm a boss, I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this

[Verse 4]
They want that shit, they often fiend
I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings
Life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean
Toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah, my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think?
I don't fuck with no hand-me-downs
See if you fuck, then it's after me
You know how much I'ma make it work?
You know her dress livin' in her purse
When you discuss your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first]

34,Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter,"[Intro]
Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, amen

[Verse]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you're handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well, is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, ""What you tryna get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
""I wanna come over, what's up?""
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

[Outro]
Please leave your message for three-two-three
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn, I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes
Man, I gotta go up to the county buildin', man, these kids ready to eat
I'm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on your way or what?
I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hoodrats out there, shit
'Specially that lil' crazy-ass girl Sherane
And plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain't gon' pass to the next grade
Eleventh grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Your daddy callin' about some damn dominoes (Let me holler at him)
He want to holler at you too, go ahead, Kenny, go'n, shit
Hello? Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
(Kenny), What?
I'm on his voicemail, damn fool (Oh), shit
Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I asked you to bring my fuckin' dominoes
Just give me the damn phone, shit, don't hang up, damn, let me
Kendrick, when you get this message, man, call me back (Keep losin' my goddamn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard)
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car (And squab, homie)
This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
It ain't all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment, fuck
Fuck some damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
Nobody wanna hear your ass
Matter fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe",Kendrick Lamar,Rap
35,LUST.,"[Chorus]
I need some water, something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood a-rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Am I asking too much? Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch—let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, ""It's okay""

Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit

[Verse 1]
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—

Door and his Nike Air Rattles

Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up

Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

I need some water, something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood a-rush my favorite vein

Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch—let me put the head in

[Verse 2]
I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money]
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""
Brace yourself]
I need some water, something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood a-rush my favorite vein

Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
Parallel park like an alien came visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello, Billy)
So many plays, homie, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 911
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
Top billin', that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch, I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby

You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pit bull

Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious

Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help

Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?

I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen""
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there

I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Chorus]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real ('Cause before you know it, everything's gone)

The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like ""because""
Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

[Skit]
Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie. Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga. Real is responsibility. Real is taking care of your motherfucking family. Real is God, nigga

[Chorus]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Skit]
Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom
Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do

""If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye.""

What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Verse 1]
Life, to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me]
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""

[Bridge]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said]
""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards""
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...

[Chorus]
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""

[Outro]
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous

Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

[Verse]
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
""Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it""
She replied, ""Oh, yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life""

Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, ""Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons""
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say, ""killa"" then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air
And everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
I'm 'bout to make my mama rich

This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'

Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can't mute me
But I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah, this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain…

Mass hallucination, baby

Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away

Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby

[Verse 2]
All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask]
Mass hallucination, baby

This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it, in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it, wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now, I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap
I would say it got me a plaque, but what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home

I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded—well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth
I know what I know, and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn’t know shit, the day I came home

I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand-me-down sneakers
Bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy, black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said, ""Kendrick, you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest-in-peace
Then be an advocate, tell your homies, especially
To come back home""

The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is

You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice in writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist, die countin' my coin

What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too

[Chorus]
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)

[Verse 1]
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, ""You crazy?""
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)

Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)

[Verse 2]
You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, ""Where's Ricardo?""
You said, ""Oh, no, not the show""
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, ""Oh, shit""
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said]
Get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)

[Poem]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home",Kendrick Lamar,Rap
48,Complexion (A Zulu Love),"[Intro]
I'm with this

[Chorus]
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

[Verse 1]
Uh, Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

[Chorus]
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Oh, Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

[Verse 2]
Dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, a feline color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, ""A woman is woman, love the creation""
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Oh, Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!)

[Verse 3]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!”
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey
I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self-esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, know colors ain’t a thing

[Outro]

Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?

49,Ronald Reagan Era (His Evils),"[Intro]
We're far from good, not good from far
90 miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top-down, screaming ""We don't give a fuck!""
Drink my 40 ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
'Cause the kids just ain't alright

[Interlude]
Oh, shit nigga, somethin' 'bout to happen, nigga, this shit..
Nigga this sound like 30 ki's under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it

[Verse 1]
Welcome to vigilante, 80's so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightnin' bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travellin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the 90's
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me that

Let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a 40-ounce to the neck and
In retrospect I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas
I tell you mothafuckas that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a 64, better know how to drive it
I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration
Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan, rake the leaves off
Your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)
He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)
He copping some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
Newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger
With calendars, cause your date's comin'
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because

She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup, she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, ""'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody""
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon

Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges

I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, ""Hah, it's our time, nigga""
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga

Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is ""sayonara, nigga""
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

I'm the only one that get the job done

Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
""Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt""
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that

[Verse 4]
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets

Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit, and when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

[Verse 1]
I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you,"" I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him""
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothin', keep restin',"" she say, ""What's missin'?"" ""How you know somethin' missin'?""
He scratch his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,"" and she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, ""Ooh""

[Refrain]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,"" and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware, she don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2]
I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you,"" she gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture, Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everythin' that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga, but she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)

[Verse 3]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa) Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin', I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself

She say, ""Ooh, Daddy, ooh,"" Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups

Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
‘Cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna",Lil Wayne,Rap
4,Mirror,"[Intro]
Uh, with everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going, but
You think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror, don't blow it

[Verse 1]
Woah, look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the

[Chorus]
Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Yeah)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

[Verse 2]
Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the..

[Chorus]
Mirror on the wall
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall (Uh-huh)
You've been my only friend (My only friend)
You told me that they can't
Understand the man I am (They can't understand)
So why are we here (Misunderstood)
Talking to each other again? (Woah)

[Verse 3]
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the...

[Chorus]
Mirror on the wall (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall (Uh)
You've been my only friend (Take 'em to Mars, man)
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we
Talking to each other again? (Uh)
Mirror on the wall (Woah)
Here we are again (Yeah)
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (Any questions?)
You told me that they can (I come to you)
Understand the man I am (You always have the answer)
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

5,Rich As Fuck,"[Verse 1]
Ugh, AK on my nightstand, right next to that Bible
But I swear with these fifty shots, I'll shoot it out with Five-O
Pockets gettin' too fat, no Weight Watchers, no lipo
Money talks, bullshit walks on a motherfucking tightrope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga, you get beat the crap out, but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose-pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night, like porch lights
Let's do it, fuck talking, we out here, we ballin'
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up; no if, ands, or butt-fucks
Bitch niggas go behind your back like nunchucks, and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly, well, tell them hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches
And that's 2 Chainz

[Chorus]
Look at you (Aw), now look at us
All my niggas look rich as fuck (Yeah)
All my niggas live rich as fuck (Yeah)
All—All my niggas look rich as fuck (Yeah)

All my—All—All my ni—

[Verse 2]
Ugh, never talk to the cops, I don't speak Pig Latin
I turnt a penny to a motherfuckin Janet Jackson
Tell the bitches that be hatin' I ain't got no worries
I just want to hit and run like I ain't got insurance, ho
What's your name? What's your sign? Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter
Yeah, murder, one-eighty-seven
I be killing them bitches, I hope all dogs go to heaven
And I got Xanax, Percocet, promethazine with codeine
Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat-ass, TV screen
I keep a bad bitch, call me the B.B. King
And you know I got that mouth out her
Then put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want
I got that ho TiVo'd, ugh
Got a red-ass bitch with a red-ass pussy
Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy
Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch
And pussy feel just like Heaven on earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt

Look at you (Uh), now look at us (Yeah)
All my niggas look rich as fuck (What?)
All my niggas live rich as fuck (What?)
All-all my niggas look rich as fuck (Yeah)
Look at you, now look at us (Get the fuck out y'all bitches, straight up)

Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

[Verse 1]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now

Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will

[Interlude]
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""wine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will

[Outro]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I'm get to it)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
'cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 2]
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy!""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me

Yeah
C5

[Chorus]
Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!

[Verse 1]
Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa!
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry, don't cry)

[Verse 2]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

[Chorus]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, whoa!
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, whoa! (Don't cry)

9,Blunt Blowin’,"[Intro]
Yeah, I put my shades on

[Verse 1]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting

Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM

And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

What the fuck, though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go
Bow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
Aimin' at your head like a buffalo
You a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat
You're a tough  guy, that's enough jokes
Then the sun die, the night is young though
The diamonds still shine in the rough, ho
What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, where the ones go?
It's a shit show, put you front row
Talkin' shit, bro? Let your tongue show
Money over bitches, and above hoes
That is still my favorite love quote
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go
If she's iffy, there the drugs go
If she sip lean, double-cup toast
I got a duffle full of hundos
There the love go, where's the uproar?

Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, woah
Puff, puff, bro; I don't huff though
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke
At your front door with a gun stowed
""Knock, knock. Who's there?"" is how it won't go
This the jungle, so have the utmost
For the nutzos, and we nuts, so
What the fuck, bro? It's where I'm from, bro
We grow up fast, we roll up slow
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow
Extra clip in the stash like a console
Listenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald
What the fuck, bro? Where the love go?
Swizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross
Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?
Hmm, to the unknown
Only way he comin' back is through his unborns
If you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?

What the fuck though? Where the love go?
Five, four, three, two, I let one go

13,Drop the World,"[Verse 1]
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker
‘Cause all this bullshit just made me strong, ma'fucker

[Chorus]
So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Uh
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

[Chorus]
So I could pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Haha, yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
I'm gone

[Bridge]
It hurts, but I never show, this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Oops, time to raise it then, your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes, I stole that fuckin' clock]
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

15,How to Love,"[Intro]
Cut the music up
A little louder

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

[Chorus]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out

Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall

Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right]
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth

20,God Bless Amerika,"[Verse 1]
Uh, my mind’s filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It’s Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain’t never lyin' yea
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die

[Hook]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
The end of time is like a hour away

[Verse 2]
Damn, military minded, lost and can’t find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea

[Verse 3]
Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don’t play, boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of command, I’m the missing link

[Hook]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

[Outro]
Here we live by the sword and die by the sword

Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket

You can play a role in my life but not the lead

They mixin' alcohol and that 'tussin (Ooh)
The demon in their eyes and they clutchin' (Scared)
I feed 'em Adderall and they bussin', yeah (Pew-pew-pew-pew-pew)
I kept the towel, not throwin' in, I'm ridin' 'round in my ends

I keep some pussy just to lick to help me out when I vent
She wanna hit that shit again, nah (Brr-brr)

It's alive, it's alive, I'm revived
It's C5, been arrived, kiss the sky, did the time
Please advise, it is advised to be advised, and we advise
You not fuck with me and mine, and keep in mind that we don't mind
Losin' our minds, free your mind, read your mind, read your mind
Body take a week to find, the cops gon' be like, ""Never mind""
What's on your mind? Put the pistol to your mind and blow your mind
Control your mind, mind freak, no sober mind, I'm so behind
But front line, you crossed the line, and you better know your lines
And if you gettin' out of line, I hang you with a clothin' line
Wring you like an open line, keep your stanky ho in line
Them hoes be lyin', it's a thin line, and I know you know the line
Second line, second line, Tunechi got effective lines
Rough edges like a box of Checkers fries, that's a line
Catch the line, American flag, less stars, extra lines
Stretch the line, skip the line, 'til you no more next in line
Yeah, Tunechi-Tune a lunatic, my goonie-goons the gooniest
Run inside your room and kill you and who you roomin' with
The Uzi with the booty clip, more than one, I'm too equipped
Talkin' 'bout some fake niggas, based on true events
Tryin' not to get pinched, smokin' on a stupid stench
Lookin' in the mirror tryin' to figure where my pupils went
Flashy with a boujee bitch, Travy, that's my hooligan (It's lit)
Take the T off Tunechi and look at it as the crucifix, bitch

22,Can’t Be Broken,"[Chorus]
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

[Verse 1]
They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say, now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you
(errr!)

[Chorus]
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen (Yeah)
When all of the lights, they get low (Low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down (You can't) what can't be broken

[Post-Chorus]
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes
G-code (Can't be broken)

[Verse 2]
I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You emulate, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil' a day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

[Chorus]
You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Uhh)

[Verse 1]
Woo, this that shit they didn't want me on
I'm 'bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lamb', I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in a wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, ""cock-a-doodle""
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you (Glory)
Glory

[Verse 2]
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-hoo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I'll sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, ""Surprise,"" but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord

[Verse 3]
Am I talkin' crazy? Too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, ""Be quiet, we need our privacy""
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, hook you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's cruisin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em

But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day (every day), niggas wrong every day (true)
Gone, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe (nope)
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space

What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
'Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushin' the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargainin' on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing

Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit

They tellin’ lies about me, aw yeah, I must've made it

But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole

So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin' all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

Uh, stop playin', I ain't with that bullshit

26,How to Hate,"[Verse 1]
She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

[Hook]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Verse 2]
And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it ""Waynes"" it pours
No really, I'm on my ""fuck that bitch"" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me

Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not forever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for ""Fuck you""

No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you

I don't want you 'round me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me

But baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

[Bridge]
I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, said I'm good
Oh, I been good
I've been out there puttin' down that work
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good

This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgetful motherfuckers

President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 1]
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms
Uh, detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no motherfucker harder than

[Chorus]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 2]
Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses

[Interlude]
Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah

[Chorus]
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter
President Carter, Pre-President Carter

[Verse 3]
Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Reality’s a bitch and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

[Outro]
Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, [chuckles]
Thank you, thank you all, I am President Carter",Lil Wayne,Rap

I'm sorry for the wait, I'm sorry for the wait (Tell 'em, tell 'em!)
Tha Carter gon' be late so I cooked up a tape (Tell 'em!)
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil homie gon' be straight!
Woo! OW!

[Chorus 1]
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Yeah, and I'm sorry for the wait, too

Fuck it (fuck it!) This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I ain't trippin', I got Barbie, I got Drake too (I ain't trippin'!)

Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who (nigga, me!)
Who was there when niggas left us? Nigga, me, that's who
Cash Money is an army, I'm a one man army (yeah)
And if them niggas comin' for me, I'm goin' out like Tony
(Bap-bap-bap-bap)
Now I don't want no problems
I just want my money (want my money)
Ain't gotta hold no conversation
Nor my luggage (nor my luggage)
Tell whoever's countin' that I'm on a hundred
Woo, Birdman Junior – more like Ugly Duckling

Takin' over, now I'm takin' over, yeah (now I'm takin' over)
Think it over? Bitch, I'm thinkin' forward, ta

All I got is Young Money – no more Cash, nigga, ayy!

[Hook 2]
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
No more am I my brother's keeper – Cain and Abel
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin'
I just chipped my tooth (Mula!)
Tell them niggas – no love lost, 'cause I ain't got shit to lose
I told myself to save yourself
'Cause I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my goons to kill somebody
I need head proof (I need head proof)
I found the needle in the haystack, put the thread through
I tried to stitch the wound back up, but I just bled through

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's compensation over conversation (no more conversation)
Lord, I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces (amen)
Lord, this game is a vampire (woo!)
Blood, you gotta protect your neck
It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord
But fuck that, nigga, got it drawn out
Fuck that nigga, I'ma ball out
The day you met me is the day Hell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out (ayy!)
I'm still in the buildin'
I just had to knock a couple walls down, had to kick y'all out (ayy)
Life is a movie, but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin'
And walk out

[Bridge]
Takin' over, Lord I'm takin' over
Dropped the Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Sippin' lean out a flask, nigga
And all I do is smoke, fuck, and thrash, nigga, ayy!

[Hook 3]
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2 (sorry for the wait)
Fuck these haters, throw your board up if you skate too
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi – niggas don't appreciate you (don't appreciate you)
You've been down since day one
It meant nothin' on day two (damn)
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow, and to say, too
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school

[Outro]
And now I'm takin' over, now I'm takin' over (takin' over)
The old me dead and gone, that's who I'm prayin' over
Might have to go back to slangin' yola 'til the wait is over

Super Bowl goals, I'm at the crib with Puff
He got Kaepernick on the phone, he in a whole different mode
Angel hair at 2AM for Bey and Hov
Just to show 'em how I treat the city like my humble abode
Ayy, tell me if TD Bank is approvin' loans
I'm thinkin' of payin' Wayne what Universal owes
My nigga spent a lifetime goin' platinum and gold
He should own half of the label, shit outta control
Somebody get Larry Jackson on the phone
I need some ownership if we pressin' go
'Cause business is boomin' on behalf of me
I need a bite outta the Apple like Adam and Eve
We gon' have to break the billi' curse
I need my paper long like ""A Milli"" verse
Or too long like a sentence from a Philly judge
Fuck is the point in all the beefin' when we really blood?
Nobody wins when the family feuds, nigga
Everybody gotta eat, we can't exclude niggas
I make the crib, expandin' pools and expandin' rooms
Addin' Hammam Spas with tannin' booths, nigga
That's truth, no boost, nigga
But this isn't all about callin' truce
I'm still dishin' out verbal abuse

I could care less 'bout your squad, I don't connect when I'm flyin'

I took the jet to Dubai, I took the jet to Milan
I took the jet way to Africa, shout out my nigga Akon
Your bitch sweatin' my squad, please get the sweat out her eye
I put the dick in her spine, I fucked the bitch in her prime
Don't get my credit declined, give all the credit to Moms
I flipped the bird at the Bird – hey, what's for dinner? Popeyes
These chickens got bird flu, and they chirp, chirp too
Always sung, never flew, these boys Hot Girls too
If money grow on trees, I climb and rest in that bitch
Build a treehouse and knock the bird nest out that bitch
Stuck my neck out and shit, then got the heck out that shit
And when I did, I took the special effect out of that shit
Tunechi F 'round this bitch

A blank check on your face, put some respek on my shit
Branches startin' to shake, here comes the leaves, get the rake
I want my piece of the cake, it should be sweeter than cake
Here come the leaves, get the rake, and we ain't leavin' the rake
We made the cleanest escape, although I bleeped in your face
You playin' wit the right one today
Your flag is a white one today
You wearin' em tight ones today
Check me or write one today
You playin' with fire today
The Angel and Lion are greats
Oh my God, lightning strikin' twice in this place
Should we make a wish or should we make it right in this place?
All this motherfuckin' beef, I need some rice on this plate
Talked to your wifey today, she feelin' triflin' she say
Talked to the sniper, he say he aimin' at diapers today
Pick you off like pickin' peppers, Peter Piper today
So tell your squad I say ""BLAOW"" like Spice 1 would say
It's Mortal Kombat tonight, it's Street Fighter today
I'm Major Bison, Drizzy lit like Raiden light up the place
You see blue face hundreds 'til you white in the face
Oh my God, it feel like I done life in this place
But swear to God, I got money doin' life in my safe
Put on the gloves like MJ, go from OG to OJ
I make you pay attention then rip your receipt in your face
This for Cita and Nae, this for my people and bae
I got three sons of a gun, them niggas keep me on safe
Hol' up, I am the black god to the church
I am the fat boy to dessert
I am the landlord to the first, got two bangers
One of them go ""bada boom,"" one of them go ""bada bing""
I taught these hoes how to love, I taught these boys how to lean
I'm high in the sky and I twinkle
The eyes don't lie 'til you blink 'em
Keep the iron for the wrinkles
The mansion came with the sprinklers
I want Arabian wealth
You snakes come make me a belt

Sucked on that pussy, I feel better already

Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
""Don't let the money come between us""
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, ""Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out""

'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out

[Interlude 2]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch

""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

[Verse 3]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet

[Outro]
Yeah, and he said
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
Let it all work out (Phew)
""Let it all work out""
(But he said, ""Remember this:"")
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
(""Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch"")
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""And don't forget what I did this, bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch"")
""Let it all—""

Oh yes I love her, like Egyptian
Want a description?
Her body's sickenin'
I can be her prescription
I can be her physician
Sexual healing
I can be her religion
And now she's kneeling
Praying to the ceiling
I bless her
As if she sneezed
Must be the weather
I dress her
I am her sleeves
I am her feathers
She's fly, flyer than you
Flyer than me
I love her, she loves me too
I love her three –
Times more than her mom
Time will tell that I'm the nigga that
She should
We should
Be wherever she wanna be
On a late night, midday, A,M
Just say when
And I know I be with cavemen
But nevermind them
She's Poison and I am Michael Bivins
See I know that y'all don't hear me
But she does
We does
What grown folk do
When they had too much to drink, and I think
We done had to much to drink, and

Oh yes I love her like; Pussy, Money, Weed
Pussy, Money, Weed; Pussy, Money, Weed

[Verse 2]
Oh yes, I love her like I oughta
I see you at the altar
Mrs. Carter
I see you with my daughter
Or son
More than one
Maybe Five, like the Jacksons
Or John Paxson
Just don't let 'em fuck up the mansion
And daddy will be home
Later on
Smellin' like the cologne
That I put on
This morn'
And I hope
That you smell like woman's soap
And shampoo, and lotion, and perfume, and candles
And I'ma run through that pussy like a vandal
Yes, I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like she's sweatin' out a fever
Wow
Leave her
To me and she'll be smiling
Every single time you see her
From ear-to-ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated
Panties are debated
Einstein; her head is the greatest

Oh yes I love her like; Pussy, Money, Weed
Pussy, Money, Weed; Pussy, Money, Weed

Oh yes I love her like her dad told her
No man
Would ever love her
Oh, and
I better be the only man
Stickin' it
Lickin' it like an envelope
Mailin' it, sealin' it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret
Don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody
Not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it
That ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station
We have sex orientation
When I hit it she squint like them Orient Asians
I do me
I say, ""Hey Ms. Chun Li, I like to see your booty
Roll, like sushi""
I'm tryna dip my celery up in her bleu cheese
""Ahs"", ""Ooh-wees""
""Voilas"", ""Tah-das""
""Mhmms"", ""Uhh-huhs""
""Oh-yeahs"", never ""Oh-nos""
Until I have to go
And then it's: ""Never! Oh, no""
I tell her, ""Don't cry
I be back like the electric bill""

35,Dark Side of the Moon,"[Verse 1]
As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted

[Chorus]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down
I turn into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin’ on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

[Chorus]
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I’ll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you (for you, for you)
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you

36,Typa Way,"[Intro]
My niggas been stuntin' since way back when
CNN, I got news for you haters
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lying
69, that's a favor for a favor

[Bridge]
Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

[Verse 1]
Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, ""Tune, not in my mouth,"" damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like ""excuse you""
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation

[Verse 2]
I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, ""See, you gon' drink your life away""
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gon' dyke today
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes.
We turnt up niggas, burnt up, stop the microwave
This shit might cost us our life, but that's the price we pay
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate
This that Dedication 5, whattup 5?

[Verse 3]
Ay Tune' I gotta turn up on the D5 man!
Hustle Gang, bang, green mean, anybody get it
Anything we'll do for the paper
And we live this shit, talk slick get kill't
Got nothin' but a tool for a hater (Spent 100K on my wrist nigga!)
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I'm drivin' make you feel some type of way (They can't afford this nigga!)
The cash I gettin' make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)
This type of way, know you feel some type of way (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
That shit ain't hot, we out here poppin' that's all I can say (G.D.O.D!)
My only problem is tryin' to decide what I'mma drive today (Hustle Gang my nigga!)
We shine all in they face, I know they feel some type of way
I wake up in a multi-million dollar crib get dressed I plan on having a nicer day
When these punk ass rappers keep my name in they mouth, like they some type of gay
You know me dog, so watch what you say (You better watch your mouth!)
We ain't playing no games with your lame ass nigga, fuckboy you can die today (I swear you can!)
I keep a chopper in my backseat, actually it's my Glock partner (My Glock, partner!)
Play crazy if you want to, fuck around and get shot partner (Get shot partner!)
I don't like these niggas, and really fuck these niggas
Talk crazy in ya raps if you want, when you see me you won't touch me nigga! (Won't touch me niggas!)
Ball all around in my flip flop, you think TIP soft? Well then why don’t you try me
If you really gon' be dramatic, we gon' to need some music, they queuein' the violin
I'm talking slow singing, flower bringing
Empty a clip in you earing, and you chest thing, and you out the door
This flooded rollie make you feel some type of way (I know it do!)
Your ho be on me, know you feel some type of way (I take your ho!)
The car I’m driving make you feel some type of way (They can’t afford this nigga!)
The cash I get it make you feel some type of way (Bankrolls-R-Us!)",Lil Wayne,Rap

I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
And violets are blue, roses are red
Daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead
Wish I could give you this feeling
I feel like buying
And if my dealer don't have no more
Then (I feel like dying) yeah

And she be by herself she a loner

You need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid
She a plus, first aid

[Verse 2]
That pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man I think he gayer than a stylist

And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up, like some Somalians
She know I got a girl but she keep this shit a thousand
Whenever we together she don't ever ask about her

[Hook V.2]
She just be like
This pussy for you
I say come and eat this bone and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
And she lay me on my back and then she blow me like boom

Shout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5!
Since '05!
Know that!

[Verse 1]
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass with your fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with your breasts showing
Like a salad, no dressing, take you to your favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread, then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when your ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And I'ma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
'Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy, coffee
Brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait, it wasn't
Oh, and I forgot, I'll take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
My homeboy like your sister, maybe they can bake some cousins
Ooh, isn't that sweet?
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

[Hook]
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song

This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

[Verse 2]
Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter—better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, ""I-I love you too""
It's Wayne's world, she say, ""What is this world coming to?""
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, ""Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?"" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
""What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate, we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear, I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of... my memory ain't what it used to be""
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

[Hook]
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you
This is not a love song, this is a you song

This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love you

I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?

Walked up to a redbone like I'm the shit
Told her, ""Give me that pussy, and fuck my bitch""

Bitch yellow, tape yellow, give you an H-A-L-O

I'm counting money, I'm smoking plants, call that shit ""math and science""
Now suck dick, Trukfit, snapback on your dog ass
These niggas broke like Mr. Glass, they don't want none, Sister Act

Swish! Michael... Phelps, nigga, in your ho
Coupe the color of YooHoo; rude boy—free Buju
Fuck wrong with these fuck niggas? I been balling since '98
Fuck y'all I'd rather skate, shoot you up in your database
I fell in love with drop-tops, I fell in love with shotguns
Our guns bigger than cop guns; y'all ain't spitting, dry tongue
I like wet pussy, she like hard dick, hard head make her soft fast

I ain't lookin' back, nigga
I'm a douchebag to these pussy ass niggas
Hammer in my drawers but I nail your bitch
Blunts like fingers, I'm 'bout to make a fist
Everybody die, gon' bury me alive
Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea
Motherfucker it's on, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone
I'll have a broke motherfucker run in your home
For a crumb and a bone

Eyes hella red like chlorine in 'em
I was gettin' that pussy, I was gettin' that money
Long hair, don't care, Hacksaw Jim Duggan
Too high to take a breath, too high to take a step
Two rights don't make a wrong, three rights make a left
The cops on my dick, the feds on my nerves
I walk it like I talk it, got legs on my words
If she don't suck dick I don't give her that dick
Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch
Money is the issue, full court pressure
I like my blunt Nutty Professor
I'm a straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money, now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying Haterade by the twelve pack
Like two stomachs
I'm laced up like two shoes, Miss Goody
Keep that ratchet, nigga
Trigger finger itchin', I'll scratch it, nigga
Blow your fuckin' brains out in traffic, nigga
Got green, New Orleans, St. Patrick, nigga
One bitch in the whip, one on the phone
The one on the phone is in front of your home
She 'bout to run in your home and put —

Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doin' with it?
Keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin' with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah, the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me ""Sir,"" call me ""Survivor""

Yep, yep

Uh, call me ""Killer"" 'cause I make a killin'

That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, 'cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track]
Uhh, yeah
And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air
And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there

She said she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoeing, but she the only one worth knowing
And yeah, I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'm a dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, ""Okay I'm your honor""
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass I just be like, ""Come sit your groceries on my counter""
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana
I dying to meet her girl, but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9
The weed is funky, but I'm smelling fine, Tunechi!

[Chorus]
Now, I know the only compass that I need
I'm putting my hat back on
Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you

[Verse 2]
I got that shit in my system
Somebody gonna be my victim
Eh, so where you at with it?
'Cause I can't do it by myself, I need a ass-sistant
I got that good-good, that get right
That early morning, that midnight
I beat it up like a fist fight, one, two, three, four, five, 6-9
That dick all in your windpipe, some of her friends I dislike
Some of your friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one, don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue, my third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind, girl, can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi

[Chorus]
""Now, I know the only compass that I need""
I'm putting my glasses back on
""Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you""

[Bridge]
Should I call somebody else?
'Cause, girl, it's almost twelve and this dick won't suck itself
Girl, you know it need some help, it'd make a nigga's day
If you said you on your way, eh, eh
Should I call somebody else?
Cuz girl it's almost twelve, and this dick won't suck itself
Girl you know it need some help, it make a nigga's day
I just hope you know the way
And she said

[Chorus]
""Now, I know the only compass that I need""
I'm putting you back on
""Is the one that leads back to you
Now, I know the only compass that I need
Is the one that leads back to you""

44,Open Letter,"[Intro]
Ah-em

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

[Verse 2]
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter

[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
Five dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
Minimum wage, $5.15
13s on the whip, kept my shit clean, uh
Actually that was my mama shit
But I’m drivin' 'round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah, I’m headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game but I got a lot of lip
That's why them niggas don’t like me and always wanna fight me

It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;

[Verse 1]
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm
I be kickin', musician inflictin' composition
Of pain, I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

[Verse 2]
Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind

[Chorus]
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

1,Ether,"[Intro]
Fuck Jay Z!
(What's up, niggas?
Ayo, I know you ain't talkin' about me, dog
You? What?!)
Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick, nigga
You love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event, y'all impatiently waitin'
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results? Not positive
Who's the best]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Interlude 1]
Ayo, pass me the weed!
Put my ashes out on these niggas, man
Ayo, you faggots, y'all kneel
And kiss the motherfuckin' ring!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishers, friendly-acting, envy-hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo, and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint (Dick!)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G
Dick-suckin' lips, why don't you let the late great veteran live?

[Interlude 2]
I… will… not… lose
God's son across the belly
I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
Ill Will, rest in peace!
Let's do it, niggas!

[Chorus]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you, ‘cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child?
Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip yo' ass, you 36 in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together: I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot ‘cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now ‘cause of your looks?
Ne-gro, please! You no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane
To Irv, to B.I.G. – and Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons! Ha!
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z – damn, you on Jaz dick!
So little shorty's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss!",Nas,Rap
2,Life’s a Bitch,"[Intro]
Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!

[Verse 1]
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
‘Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, ‘cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
‘Cause life's a bitch and then you die

[Chorus]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

[Verse 2]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated ‘cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, ‘cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

[Chorus]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
‘Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die

3,The World Is Yours,"[Chorus]
(It's yours)
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 1]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

[Chorus]
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

[Verse 2]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life (It's yours)
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

[Chorus]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
Yo, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)

[Bridge]
Break it down
It's yours, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours

[Verse 3]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today

[Chorus]
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this? (Yeah)
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?
(It's yours)

[Outro]
(Break it down) Yeah, aight
To everybody in Queens, the foundation (It's yours)
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (It's yours)
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours (It's yours)
The world is yours
Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (It's yours)
Long Island, yo, the world is yours (It's yours)
Staten Island, yeah, the world is yours (It's yours)
South Bronx, the world is yours (It's yours)

4,The Message,"[Verse 1]
Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

[Refrain]
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'

[Verse 2]
I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
But, uh—a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers (Word up)

[Refrain 2]
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
Ther–Ther–Ther–There ain't an army that could strike back
Y'a–Y'all know my steelo
There ain't an army that could strike back

[Outro]
Thug niggas, yo, to them thug niggas
Gettin' it on in the world, you know?
To them niggas that's locked down
Doin' they thing, survivin', ya know'm sayin'?
To my thorough niggas, New York and worldwide
Yo, to the Queensbridge Militia
9-6 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic, nigga, It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin'
Y'all fake niggas, tryin' to copy
Better come with the real though, fake-ass niggas, yo
(They throw us slugs, we throwin' them back, what)
Bring the shit, man! Live, man!
(Fuck that son, word up) 9-6 shit",Nas,Rap
5,It Ain’t Hard to Tell,"[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep? Well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell",Nas,Rap
6,One Love,"[Verse 1]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

[Hook]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 2]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

[Hook]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Outro]
To all my niggas locked up
From Queensbridge and all over
To my man [Goon?], one love
To my man Herb, one love
To my man [Lake Gucciano?], one love
Can't forget my motherfuckin' heart, Big [Bo?], one love
To [Oogie?], yeah, one love",Nas,Rap
7,If I Ruled the World (Imagine That),"[Intro]
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

[Verse 1]
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

[Chorus]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2]
The way to be]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse 3]
You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

[Chorus]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons,I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Outro]
If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons
Black diamonds, I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em, love 'em baby!",Nas,Rap
8,Represent,"[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 1]
Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Aiyyo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 2]
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

[Chorus]
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent

[Verse 3]
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Bokeem, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love

[Chorus]
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent
Represent y'all, represent

[Outro]
One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life in every projects, all over
To my man Big Will, he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon, my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters, the 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas, my man Cormega, Lakey the Kid
Can't forget Draws, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogie
Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove), we rock shit a lot, PHD
And my man Preemo from Gang Starr
'94 real shit y'all (word up Harry O)
Fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though!

[Nas' posse]
Bitch ass niggas! Bitch ass niggas!
You bitch ass motherfuckers!
Come to Queensbridge, motherfucker!
Yeah, yeah, let's bring it back
That's just a warm up

(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like; Nas is like; Nas is like)
Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;
Nas is like)

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered—the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10s to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking it light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell (Nas, Nas, Nas)

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel (Uh, uh)
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (Uh)
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 2]
(Nas is like) Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death - the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blasting TECs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing (C'mon)
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh)

[Verse 3]
(Nas is like) Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, busting heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies
I'm like all races combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now

[Chorus]
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt
Nas is like; life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like; half-man, half-amazing
No doubt (Uh); Nas is like",Nas,Rap

Aight, fuck that shit! Word, word
Fuck that other shit, y'know what I'm sayin'?
We gonna do a lil somethin' like this
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
(Stay up on that shit)
Keep it on and on and on and on and
Know'm sayin'? Big Nas, Grand Wizard, God, what is it?
(It's like…) Haha, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun!

[Verse 1]
I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' match, from craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, so roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace, God!) Peace, God – now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that, y'all…

[Chorus]
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

[Verse 2]
One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God

11,Halftime,"[Intro]
(Right… Right…)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

[Verse 1]
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'm a ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change, I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime

[Chorus]
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Aiyyo, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime

[Chorus]
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

[Verse 3]
I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out

[Outro]
(Right…) It's still halftime
(Right…) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right…) '92, it's halftime
(Right…) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost

12,Affirmative Action,"[Intro]
This is what, this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about?
Word, time to take Affirmative Action, son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
Niggas don't understand the four devils
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy—wicked niggas, man

[Verse 1]
Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact
Sip your con-gi-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break
Undress 'em, tie 'em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone
Or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats, politickin' daily with diplomats
See me, I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

[Verse 2]
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a ki of heroin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got an ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega the pretty boy with mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it!

[Verse 3]
Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that somebody-gotta-die shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice, so Hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Señor Escobar

[Verse 4]
In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moët Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby, from BK to the Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait, it's half-and-half
Ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16
Double it, times three, we got 48, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight, we back to 16
Now add the other two that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

[Outro]
The Firm, baby, Vol. 1",Nas,Rap
13,One Mic,"[Intro]
One time, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with 9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!

[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way]
All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic (this is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby)",Nas,Rap
14,Daughters,"[Intro]
Check it out
I call it, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters

[Verse 1]
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

[Verse 2]
This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

[Verse 3]
And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love",Nas,Rap
15,Cherry Wine,"[Chorus]
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

[Verse 1]
I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo, I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she?

[Chorus]
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

[Verse 2]
I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'?
I be tryin' to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool to ask?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I'd gallivant around the Equator, if that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris' with some lime, what is this?
An immaculate version of ""Me & My Bitch"" by Biggie
With all respect, 'cause you the only one that gets me

[Chorus]
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, let’s pour some cherry wine
Everything’s good, everything’s fine
Yeah, yeah, we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, hey yo, Salaam
Yeah, I think they know the time
Everything’s good, everything’s fine
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah
Life is good, life is good, yeah
Life is good, no matter what, life is good
Life is good, life is good, yeah
No matter what, life is good

[Chorus]
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry",Nas,Rap
16,I Can,"[Intro]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""

[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Outro]
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music, y'all
Save the music

17,Hate Me Now,"[Intro]
Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

[Chorus 1]
You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-lib over Chorus]
Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!

[Verse 1]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Ad-libs]
Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary

[Chorus 2]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Cmon)
You can hate me now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now

[Ad-Libs]
Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

[Verse 2]
You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin']
You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!

[Chorus 2]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-libs]
I like this, I like the way this feels

[Verse 3]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the fury of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

[Ad-libs]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Chorus 2]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Outro]
You can hate me now, (C'mon, niggas!)
But I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit over with!)
It ain't gon' never stop, niggas!",Nas,Rap
18,The Don,"[Intro]
He's the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people
The people who cannot afford to go to big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality

[Sample from ""Dance Inna New York"" by Super Cat]

Smoking a escubano, guzzle my second bottle
Hope I don't catch a homo
Grossing our net, simultaneously making me climb higher
Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me, fuck sadness
Had this been you having this lavish
Habitual happiness, at me you wouldn’t look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two TECs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi
My Colombiana mommy riding beside me
Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body
I’ll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty
My niggas is ignant, put lead in your pigment
Just 'cause y'all was mad at all the years I was getting it
In '97 the six, '98 the Bentley
Now it’s the Ghost Phantom, and y'all can't stand him but

Army jacket swag, army jacket green and black
With the square top pocket that snaps
Where the gas at?
Pass that, not you, you hold cracks in your ass crack
I never did that, my sock's where my stash was at
Yo, I used to listen to that Red Alert and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cutting school where Preme team and Fat Cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet, Baccarat
Now I'm the one who repping Queens
Way beyond your wildest dreams
Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
Twenty years in this game, looking seventeen
I don't lean]

New York is like an Island, a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wilding, all I hear is sirens
It's all about surviving
Same old two-step, try to stay alive when they be out robbing
I been out rhyming since born knowledge
Like prophet Muhammad said the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr, so I'ma
Keep it on 'til I see a billion dollars
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Love model chocha, mommy pop it like she 'pose to
Eyes red shot like I'm never sober
Big time smoker, Indonesian doja
Mini me's you can hold up
Before you end up wet up from my soldier

19,​everything,"[Pre-Chorus]
You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll love, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

[Chorus]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all?
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
Let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart
See 'cause you've never been the same as anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
This is your call, there are no wrongs
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

[Chorus]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything, I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
When the media slings mud, we use it to build huts
Irrefutable facts, merciful, beautiful black beloved brother
You fail to embarrass him, harassin' him
To my life, your life pales in comparison
So go write whatever blog, messiness is not ever the God
Do what's necessary, I'm never worried
Listen vultures, I've been shackled by Western culture
You convinced most of my people to live off emotion
That's why we competin', death by the chrome barrel
Forgot the secrets, my Kilimanjaro bone marrow's the deepest
You can peep at the comments, but don't fall for that
We want freedom, I'm a scholar; an almanac
People do anything to be involved in everything
Inclusion is a hell of a drug
Some people have everything they probably ever wanted in life
And never have enough

[Chorus]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
From the birth of a child, the world is foul
Excursions of a searchin' child
Should learn to take nothin' personal
A parent hates to watch his baby's face
Takin' his first immunization shots, but this is great
The child's introduction to suffering and pain
Understands without words, nothin' is explained
Or rushed to the brain, lookin' up at his parents' face
Like, ""I thought you would protect me from this scary place?""
""Why'd you let them inject me?""
""Who's gonna know how these side effects is gonna affect me?""
Who knew I would grow to meet presidents that respect me?
If Starbucks is bought by Nestlé, please don't arrest me
I need to use your restroom and I ain't buy no espresso
Soon enough, assume the cuffs, the position
Not new to us, since back on the bus sittin'
Said, ""Screw that bus!"" – boycotted that bus outta business
The future's us, yet every citizen's in prison

[Chorus]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Watch me as I walk through the folly, golly, New York to Saudi
In Italy, I'm Eduardo Vaccari
But Nasty the hustler, nasty like mustard gas, sulfur
And I could sell Alaska to Russia, no pressure
My first house, 11,000-square-feet mansion
It was a haunted by dead rich whites
Mad a nigga bought his crib to hang up pictures of black Christ
Circular driveways, black cars and black ice
My second house, still in my twenties, illin' with money
Chilled through my spine, spillin' wine, it's funny
Did good for a staircase loiterer, euphoria
What you saw when you seen a teen turn to a warrior
Did every Fourth of July, bustin' in the sky
It was important to a guy who was mob-minded
Future Murciélago driver 'til Lambos got average on me
I started likin' the look like I ain't had no money
Yellow taxi seats over Maybach seats
Just to remind me, just to inspire me
To stay focused, it's a real sick society
Just 'cause I got your support don't mean you're buyin' me
I'm buyin' back the land owned by the slave masters
Where my ancestors lived, just to say a rapper
Made a change, the pants-sagger put plans in action
To lay claim the Pan-African made it happen

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll live, and you'll learn
See 'cause you've never been the same anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else
You'll live, and you'll learn
See you'll never conclude with anyone else
Don't think the same as everyone else

[Chorus]
If I had everything, everything
I could change anything
If I changed anything, I mean anything
I would change everything, oh yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Dark boy, don't you cry
There's too much life left in those eyes
Don't you let that face go waterfall
Don't you learn to love your scars and all
Dark boy, don't you die
They're just human, let them lie
You just know your world and speak your truth
And let them come to you
For you'll love, in your heart

Haha, haha, check it

[Chorus 1]
One time 4 your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time 4 your mind, one time
Yo, whatever
One time 4 your mind, one time
Aiyyo, Nas? Kick that fuckin' rhyme!

[Verse 1]
Check it out
When I'm chillin', I grab the buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After bein' blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Picking up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rockin' the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well, a cappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, hops, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten, I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rockin' microphones and twistin' off a 40 top

[Chorus 2]
One time 4 your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time 4 your mind, one time
It sounds clever
Aiyyo, Nas? Fuck that, man, that shit was phat
But kick that for them gangstas, man, fuck all that!
Right, right

[Verse 2]
What up niggas, how y'all? It's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writin' rhymes, but besides that, I'm chillin'
I'm tryin' to get this money, God
You know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold, be starvin' make you wanna do crimes, kid
But I'ma lamp ‘cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catchin' 3 to 9's, Muslims yellin' ""Free the mind""
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid, when I would say that outta town, niggas chased us
But now, I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a 9, fine, see, now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floatin' like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write, my hand is hot
And expand the lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pah
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11, and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in heaven

[Chorus 3]
One time 4 your mind, one time
It sounds clever
One time 4 your mind, one time
Yeah, whatever
One time 4 your mind, one time
Yo, from '92 to '99

[Outro]
Yeah, that shit was crazy phat, pah
Know what I’m sayin'?
But check it, you got another verse for me
I want you to kick it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Kick that shit for the projects",Nas,Rap
21,Bye Baby,"[Intro]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 1]
Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar, that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave – let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming
""Hate you so much right now""
Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving

[Chorus]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 2]
Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself – and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican, you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like ""Ha, yo, look at my wife!""
Gangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened, and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby, guess what...

[Chorus]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
OH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Verse 3]
Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass and I'm talking half
Not some, but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards
Under their breath, saying, ""Why did Nas trust her?""
But look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!
You live with your baby moms
And scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type
And watch me do it all again – it’s a beautiful life, aight?
Goodbye!

[Chorus]
(Bye baby) Baby.. baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
I can't believe that this is happening to us
'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)
I guess you knew and blew a good thing
You know I'm saying bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby

[Outro]
'Til we make love just one more time
Make it seem forever
This is our last and final goodbye
Goodbye",Nas,Rap
22,Adam and Eve,"[Verse 1]
The ghetto Othello, the Moor
Oh my God, they speak venomous on the boy
Oh my Lord, my enemy is fear, and I'm sure
Oh my God, they want the end of me 'cause I'm pure
Oh my Lord, discipline for the win, I just go for it
It's a trend for these men to die on their own sword
Journey far, learn who you can be
But you can learn who you are when you around family
Chip off the shoulders of soldiers, on they grizzle
My granddaddy Mack Little married Nannie Little
They passed down wisdom, blessings were given
Pray my sins don't get passed to my children
I made a killin', I'm alive like the morning star
Court Jordan's for the price on stock, so what the Hornets are?
I need evaluations, I'm savvy, y'all
Eatin' foie gras and caviar, listen

[Chorus]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

[Verse 2]
The ghosts of gangsters dance
Chinchillas shake on the hanger, the force of this banger
Yeah, my language advanced, my cadence amazin'
The voice triggers somethin', what is this conundrum?
The clouds scurry, your spirit rumble, a boyish smile
Still puff the loud, it's nothin' less than a quarter pound
Savage narrative, every verse that I write bursts light
Brings awareness to my personal life
After my morning walk, Havana cigar, the ganja spark
See my doctor more, sweat in the sauna or the spa
Spendin' fifty large at the Bellagio
Spent twenty on a bad bitch I hardly know
New girl every night, two girls was every other night
Sexual addiction, gangster tradition
They wanna fuck me, have me under they belt, slightly offended
Yeah, that's how I felt, that's how it ended
I'm just good at existin', existin' in my truth
As long as I enjoy the fruit, yeah

[Chorus]
Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, ayy
Adam and Eve, Adam and Eve
Don't fall too far from the apple tree, apple tree

[Verse 3]
What come first, peace or the paper?
Before I had a piece of paper, peace was in my favor
Before I sat to eat at the table, it had leeches and traitors
Cut the fat from the meat, extract the weak, bon appetit
No bacon, brothers is swine
It's so hard to trust 'em 'cause my hustle is mine
It's evident they all the same, with gray hair and still mean muggin'
Gray hairs of wisdom, that means you seen somethin'
Say somethin', you stay frontin'
But these clowns got false crowns, fictitional kings
You broke my heart, Fredo
You bring this thing of ours down to a fable
Be advised my guys dyin', enterprisin' at a boss's table
There's always room at my table
Insecurities is keepin' you disabled
All this money to get, is there less time?
They ain't stopped printin' money, 'cause they made mine
I learned to stretch time, these are the best times
I'm in my neighborhood in stadiums, the Mets' kind
With restaurants and Carbone, spicy rigatoni
Go hard, a red Bordeaux, oh God

Bravehearts, Bravehearts, Bravehearts…

[Verse 1]
Now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't Five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, lookin' for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack — where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 2]
This ain't rappin', this is Street Hop
Now get up off yo' ass like your seat's hot
My live niggas lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music defuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

[Chorus]
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
They shootin'! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
I see niggas runnin', yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk chazzers

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle

25,Take It in Blood,"[Hook]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex, watchin' Kathie Lee & Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezin' executioner
Winter time, I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxin', my bitches, they be laughin'
They high from sniffin' coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sippin', Sergio Tacchini
Flippin' mad pies, low price, I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods poppin' wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip-hop's got me on some ol', sprayin' shots like a drum roll
Blankin' out, never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate
Watchin' crab niggas marinate
I'm all about TECs, a good jux and sex
Israelite books, holdin' government names from Ness
MC's are crawlin' out every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum

[Hook]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's

[Verse 2]
Currency is made in the trust of The Messiah
I'm spendin' it to get higher
Earth, Wind and Fire singin' Reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy as a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill
Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be buggin' out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, gettin' niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'mma pause like a comma in a sentence
Paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're lookin' out the sky's moon-roof
Shittin' like gin and prune juice
Yo, the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up
It's off the hook while I just wrote a statement
Like I'm facin' twenty years in the basement
Chillin' on a VI with Mumia, for wearin' chrome
I told the judge snakes slither like Sharon Stone
But like Capone, I'm thrown, yo

[Hook]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
For you wack MC's

Lyrical, ly-lyrical

[Verse 3]
Yo, the time is wastin', I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin', court pen pacin'
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation we livin' in
Dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealin' boy
Coke suppliers actin' biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's
Just the killer in me, slash drug dealer, MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo, simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and butt-holes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed toward the peasy haired brick houses
And studded-up, thick medallions
Rich niggas transportin' thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin' to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped
Watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catchin' mad feelings
Peelin' off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin'
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TECs you blessed, word
So, now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money, when it comes to mine, take it in blood

[Hook]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin' like that

26,I Gave You Power,"[Intro]
Damn
Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me, right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up

[Verse 1]
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me, bullets spray
They use me wrong, so I sing this song to this day
My body is cold steel, for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats, they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches, four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered
They pull me out, I watch as niggas scattered
Making me kill, but what I feel, it never mattered
When I'm empty, I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves, under beds
So I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads

[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 2]
Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick
Uncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear
Stunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys
For years, I've been used in robberies
Giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

[Chorus]
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild
How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

[Verse 3]
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear
He's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody coming in
Open the shelf, his eyes bubbling
He said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him
Shaking, somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of them thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split
So fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!",Nas,Rap

Candid shit only
Scared motherfuckers

[Verse 1]
Black Kemet gods (yeah), black Egyptian gods (let's go)
Summoned from heaven, blessed, dressed in only Goyard
Homie go hard like Stone and Robert in a stolen car
Shoot the ballot box, no voter card, they all are frauds
Senegal's finest, minerals, diamonds
The Earth is cursed but I survive many climates
Calm and thoroughly, they try to Hyman Roth me
John Fitzgerald me, the industry never bought me
(You know God sent me here)
Fear will make you reveal who you really are
Feel me God? Be solid, your foes hold you in ill regard
This ain't knowledge, this is not intense
For honored men, women too
Us who can see the same thing, but have a different view (let's go)
All of a sudden, frontin' niggas knew you from your past
Got all kinds of guys sayin' we go way back
And who y'all comparin' me to is nonsense
Show gratitude in the presence of dominance

[Chorus]
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared of us
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared
To Catholics…

[Verse 2]
To Catholics, Moors and Masons (motherfuckers!)
John Hanson was not the first black pres to make it
Abe Lincoln did not free the enslaved
Progress was made 'cause we forced the proclamation
(Fuck your proclamation!)
SWAT was created to stop the Panthers
Glocks were created for murder enhancement
For hunting men, circumstances
Edgar Hoover was black
Willie Lynch is a myth, Colombians created crack
The government made stacks (welcome to America, niggas!)
Reagan had Alzheimer's, that's true
Fox News was started by a black dude, also true (fuck you too!)
Convinced my experiences were meant to be
Helps me navigate as they validate they treachery
Felt established, fake as he smile, handshake questionable
""Am I good?"" he ask, thinkin', ""But is he testin' you?""
(Is he testin' you?) In my hood, fear does a few things
Make you pussy, make you a snitch
Make irrational moves or even turn you to food

[Chorus]
I think they're scared of us, yeah
I think they're scared of us
I think they're scared of us, yeah
I think they scared
I think they scared of us, yeah
I think they scared of us
See, we don't care about what you think about us
I think they scared of us, yeah
What you say about us
I think they scared
You bitch ass, yeah

[Outro]
Ayo, that's why they be killing us and shooting us
That's why they feel uncomfortable around us
'Cause of our greatness
You're lucky God made us compassionate
And forgiving
Pssh, man, they scared of us, Nas
We see that bitch in your eyes",Nas,Rap
28,Get Down,"[Chorus]
Get, get, get down!

[Verse 1]
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""

[Chorus]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Verse 2]
Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded ""cool,"" but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

[Chorus]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!
Everybody
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Outro]
All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change",Nas,Rap
29,Wrote My Way Out,"[Chorus]
(""I wrote my way out"")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, th'was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and ""I wrote my way—"" out

[Verse 1]
I picked up the pen like Hamilton
Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em
No political power—just lyrical power
Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours
Schemin' on a come up, from evening to sun up
My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger
Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence
Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant
Flickerin' lights inside my project hall
Sickenin', the mice crawl all night long
And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on
Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
Master bedroom, bigger than the crib that I was raised at
I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens
The definition of what It Was Written means
Know what I mean?

[Chorus]
(""I wrote my way out"")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and ""I wrote my way—"" out

[Verse 2]
I really wrote my way up out of 6E
Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me
Before the metrocards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed
Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was a sixteen?
At sixteen, arrested in housin', trip to the mountains
Came right back, trappin' off couches, watchin' for mouses
Only tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit
The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch
Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans
Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border
That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak
I persevered, composition, I kept it close
Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear
Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it
Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin'
This poetry in motion, I'm a poet

[Chorus]
(""I wrote my way out"")
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Runnin' on empty, there was nothin' left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen and I wrote my way out!

[Verse 3]
High speed, dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check
My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak
In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back
Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin';
""Oh, you think you smart?""—Blaow!—start bleedin'
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
Sister tapped my brains, said, ""Pssh—you'll get 'em right back.""
Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in
The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless?
""Damn, you got no chill,"" fuckin' right—I'm relentless
I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery
This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out?

[Bridge]
(""I wrote my way out"")
Oh, I was born in the eye of a storm
No lovin' arms to keep me warm
This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear
I can do without, I'm here (I'm here)
'Cause ""I wrote my way—"" out!

Uh huh, they ready)
Yeah, word
Got some Rémy Martin
And some good-ass cigars, check it out

[Verse 1]
Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of Scotch
Smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cutter'd
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semi-automatic weapons I brought
The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince ‘em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD

[Verse 2]
Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage
I am the dragon
Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege
Talk trash 'bout the Nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'?
Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it
You envy, but don't offend me
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me?
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the 90's
Drug dealer car, rush to the bar
Move, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact, haha...

[Interlude]
(Nasty) Nasty kid
(Nasty) Yeah...
(Nasty) The kid! (Nasty) Yeah...
(Nasty) Nasty kid (Nasty)

[Verse 3]
For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin'
Saying, ""It was Nas I used to hustle with""
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish
Guns on my waist, past this
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors
For my team, nigga, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
I’m no fake rap CD listener, sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my G's, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga",Nas,Rap
31,Street Dreams,"[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings?

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 2]
From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from being rich
But now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM'
Word is bond, son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 3]
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat, no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

32,Cops Shot the Kid,"[Intro]
The cops used to come around in my neighborhood
""Alright, you kids, stop having so much fun, move along!""
Oh they'd arrest me, you know, especially at night
They had a curfew, niggas had to be home at 11, negros, 12
And you'd be trying to get home, doing your crew runs
And they'd always catch you out in front of a store or something
'Cause you'd be taking shortcuts, right
Cops, ""Ree, put your hands up, black boy!""

[Chorus]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna hurt nobody
We just came here to party
See a few dames, exchange some names
I'm a top shotta, kid, stay in your lane
The cop shot the kid, same old scene
Pour out a little liquor, champagne for pain
Slap-boxin' in the street
Crack the hydrant in the heat
Cop cars on the creep
Doin' they round-ups, we just watch for the sweep
Yeah, it's hotter than July
It's the summer when niggas die
It's the summer when niggas ride
Together we'll be strong, but forever we divide
So y'all are blowin' my high
Type of shit that's killin' my vibe
White kids are brought in alive
Black kids get hit with like five
Get scared, you panic, you're goin' down
The disadvantages of the brown
How in the hell the parents gon' bury their own kids
Not the other way around?
Reminds me of Emmett Till
Let's remind 'em why Kap kneels

[Chorus]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream

[Verse 2]
Stay tuned up and down your timeline
This fake news, people is all lyin'
Money is bein' made when a mom cries
Won't be satisfied 'til we all die
Tell me, who do we call to report crime
If 9-1-1 doin' the driveby?
It's certain things I can't abide by
I ain't bein' extreme, this is my side
Talkin' big shit, ready to die
I know every story got two sides
Claimin' he paranoid by the black guy
Cop wanna make it home by nighttime
Just a good kid, he wasn't that guy
Had a little hit, he wasn't that high
Cop gon' claim that it was self-defense
Say he was ridin' dirty so the case rests

[Chorus]
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (workin' nine-to-five)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (tryna stay alive)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (makin' ends meet)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot– (shot him this week)
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
The cops shot the kid, the cops shot–
The cops shot the kid
I still hear him scream",Nas,Rap

J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League

[Verse 1]
PS 111 had free lunch
Embarrassed but managed to get a plate...
We was kids hungry
Mom's working, I was famished
She getting home late...
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full or starve
Corner store like ""Mister, spare-a-quarter""
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
Fifteen, I got a gun
Sixteen, I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun
What's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of
Dudes who switch up and change
They wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them though, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow

[Break]
""Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!""

[Verse 2]
I remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth two hundred million now
Bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers
To take over J.P. and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back

""Say YEAH! Haha, thank ya! Ahhh, Hallelujah!
Y'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!""

1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him
I spread em, hit 'em and dead 'em
She says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven
She says, it is the greatest loving
The tales you hear is the truth on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you're too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis, this goes to her with love
Also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha

Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooooh-ooh-oh...

[Verse 1]
Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Bimmer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just.. stay

Oooh-oooh-ooooooh, ooh-ooooh...
Staaaaaaaay... Oooh-oooh-ooooh-ooooooh

[Verse 2]
Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you?
I might kill you but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures
Through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to.. stay

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome]

Yo, I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And if I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a, barber's preciseness
Bravehearted for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"" with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is NASDAQ though, in my Nascar, with this Nas flow
What could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)

It's, the, return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist' – I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (uhh)

I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)

36,Hip Hop Is Dead,"[Intro]
Hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
(Had to flip this track again, y'all!)
Hip, hip hop, hip hop (Ugh!) is dead
Hip, hip hop (Ugh!)
Hip, hip hop is dead (NYC! Dirty South!)
Hip, hip hop (West Coast!)
Hip hop (Midwest!)
Hip hop (Let's go!)

[Hook]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, niggas smoke, chill, party and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya, ""Nas helped grow us up""
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf
So people, who's your top 10? Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day

And she's dead, she's dead)

[Verse 2]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why's that?
‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crack
‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now

If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake

Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ

And she's dead, she's dead)

Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From ""Beat Street"" to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder

And they came to show love

That's my niggas over there, word

[Verse 1]
If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gon' cock it and pop it? His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him, slangin just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'
'Cause he feel a way]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough
Or Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

[Verse 2]
It's been so long, can’t remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off
I see your moms, she still speak
She don't know I ain't cool with her son no more
It’s old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?
Constantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?
It’s quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas' names
I wonder, will it change? Let's ride…

[Chorus]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that’s fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough

Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more

[Verse 3]
It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down, little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess
Lear jets, I ask myself]
I want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough

38,Accident Murderers,"[Verse 1]
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man
Missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, 'cause of a

[Chorus]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

[Verse 2]
We grew up doing graffiti, now hollow heads getting heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up
20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight
We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a TEC off the shelf, live forever; that's Insh'Allah

Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodging my clique
Cut a check; I use your bitch for some bargaining chips
In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't

[Chorus]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of 'em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

[Bridge]
Accident murderer
Accident murderer, you just an accident murderer

[Verse 3]
Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sister?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping
But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Think of my nigga Drawz, but you aren't a name to me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary

[Chorus]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer",Nas,Rap
39,You’re da Man,"[Verse 1]
Uh uh, yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flame
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas – too real, Nas – true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming
Soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since ""... Barbeque""
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I, ever make a record, I take a cheque
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with crack in my sock, asleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the crafts of the streets
But look at me now

[Chorus]
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man

[Verse 2]
Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

[Chorus]
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man
You're the man, you're the man",Nas,Rap

42nd Street Terminal

[Sounds of a subway train]

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it, my religion is reefer
Big money and the most uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic, nothing is figurative
I can wish it into existing, God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this
Pointing to they scars like, right here, baby, really Nas did this
Like a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothing's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Dempsey, matte black Bentley, pimply
Shattering your silence, passing round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife 'cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

[Break]
Yo, what we talking 'bout niggas?
What we talking 'bout niggas?
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, Nasty, what, recollect motherfucker

[Verse 2]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing
Integrity intact, repping hard
They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top
Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something
To keep winning is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances
A soldier coming home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good 'cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash, huh

[Break]
My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we pushed it, mush it
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem, Bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at?

[Verse 3]
At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot
Staggering, drunker than them cops that 2Pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed reaching
Soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting
Looking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Bugging on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I, must be, something in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all

[Outro]
This for my trapped in the 90s niggas
For my trapped in the 90s niggas

41,What Goes Around,"[Intro]
Yeah..

[Chorus]
Ayo, it's poison]
In hospitals, shots riddle the block, little
Children and elderly women run for they lives
Drizzlin' rain come out the sky every time somebody dies
Must be out my fuckin' mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sendin' flowers to funerals, readin' Rest In Peace
You know, the usual, death comes in threes
""Life is short"" is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
And funny how these black-killer companies is makin' money off us
Fast food, Cola, soda, Skull and Bone crosses – it's all poison

[Chorus 2]
Ecstasy, coke, you say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned, they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescriptin' us medicine which is poison
Doctors injectin' our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison
Sisters up in my hood try to do good, given choices

[Verse 2]
When pregnant, drop out of school or have abortions
Stop workin', hopin' that they find a man that will support them
Up late night, on they mother's cordless
Thinkin' a perm or bleachin' cream will make them better, when they're gorgeous
White girls tannin', liposuction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction
Light-skinned women, bi-racial
Hateful toward themselves, denyin' even their blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods
But I overstand the mental poison that's even worser than drugs

[Chorus 3]
Yo, it's poison]
Never to worry, all the wrong-doers got it coming back to 'em a thousand times over
Every dog has its day, and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to 'em
Everybody reaps what they sows, that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken
It may get worse, but we'll get through it, y'all, be strong!

[Verse 3]
The China-men built the railroad, the Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed 'em
They call it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday ""hell-day""
‘Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches, and party everyday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles, connectin' and we hittin' the lab
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad

[Chorus 4]
It's all poison]
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga

[Verse 4]
This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey, light-skinned with herpes
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C
This is the problem, ‘cause he never tell 'em he got it
From lettin' fags suck him off, Rikers Island in '93
Drives a Benz, hangs at all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rockin' they shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
What's your name? Where you from?
Chain blingin', thinkin' girls everywhere is dumb
Takin' pride in ruinin' their lives
So they could never have babies and they could never be wives
He never used a condom; give him head? He got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDS
I contemplate, believin' in karma
Those on top could just break and won't be eatin' tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleepin' on a nigga's dreams
They leave; when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' their seeds
Instead of takin' care of 'em they're spendin' money on trees
I pray for you, deadbeat daddies
'Cause when them kids get grown
It's too late for you]
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga
What goes around comes around, my nigga
And what goes up, it must come down, my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground, my nigga
Just hold it down, we older now, my nigga",Nas,Rap
42,Purple,"[Intro]
Light it, uhh
Light it up, uhh

[Verse 1]
The whole city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it
It's just an intro, hate it or love it, like it, bump it or dump it
Write it, across the stomach spell ""God son""
Life is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible?
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle
I'm blowin' circles, my state of mind purple

[Break]
Light it, light it, uhh
Yeah… light it up
Light it up, uhh

[Verse 2]
Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who got things, y'all ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryna be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground, but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you, but behind your back, they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tear in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple

Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Light it up… light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh… uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

[Verse 3]
These hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of suspect faces
It's usually two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
And Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
Too much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple",Nas,Rap
43,Bonjour,"[Verse 1]
(Bonjour) I should be more mature, sure, I'm spoiled
Hit up the south of France after tour, bonjour (bonjour)
How many girls pre-bate right before they date
So she can have restraint? She still get slayed (bonjour)
That's ill behavior, want the whip matted
Want her ass the fattest, beat it]

Plenty of kisses, plein de bisous
Good day and best wishes

Eat at selective kitchens, speak on our next intentions
Over-creamy Polenta, it come chef recommended (bonjour)
Come through the side entrance; I arrived, bitches

Vacations I didn't like, put myself through a guilt trip (bonjour)
All these beautiful places, but the cities be poor
You wealthy when your kid's upbringin' better than yours
All this money we gettin' could be gone in a minute
If we don't invest it—we long-term affected
Watch who you gettin' pregnant, that's long-term stressin'
I got a mil for every bump on your face, that's what I call a blessin'

My head looks straight up
And I'm wonderin', ""What did I do?"" (bonjour)
She looked at me like, ""Damn, did I surprise you?""
Sure enough, as the sky's blue, she turned back around
And walked back down the avenue (bonjour)
She's waitin' for the right cue (bonjour)
I'm waitin' for the right clue (bonjour)

I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? (Hahaha)
Let's go... uhh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, yeah, that's perfect (yeah, right, right)
Uhh, uh, you gotta take ya time, make a nigga wait on this muh'fucka (hahaha!)
Make niggas mad and shit like
Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in!
Just start dancin' in this muh'fucka
Yeah, (yeah) we just come outta nowhere

[Chorus]
I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, like, ""Fuck it then""

[Verse 1]
Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (what?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end?
Like Ice Cold's album (uhh), all good things
Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one good reign, could bring
Should blame, the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And forever be in debt, and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Although we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things]
I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them (nah)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, ""Fuck it then""

[Verse 2]
I'm back in the hood, they like, ""Hey Nas"" (uh)
Blowin' on purp, reflectin' on they lives (uh)
Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5s, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, ""Why""? (uhh)
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good, that form street politics?
Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce (uhh)
To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word

[Chorus]
I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)
Probably end up back in the hood, ah, ""Fuck it then""
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them

A vet stylin' in Met Gala, tuna salad from La Scala
Black sweats, swallow a lot of reefer
God, it hard to quit the bottom feeder, lobster eater
When I fast, I see Elijah's features
A million cash for a Nas feature
Nah it's cheaper, do it for free if you do it for me
52 bar verse if the beat is movin' me
Stumble through customs, coppin' Cubans at the Duty Free
Layin' on the most expensive beds, still I'm losin' sleep
Next to Jet's Beauty of the Week 1993
Chin-grabber, neck-choker, in-her-mouth-spitter
Blouse-ripper, ass-gripper, that dig-you-out nigga
I ain't gon' hold you, old head gave me old news
I don't owe you, shoulda heard when I told you
You are an extension of what I've worked hard to build
You believe in your own lies, can't be real
And the odds is that what you love can kill you
Like a heart physician who dies from a heart attack
I know the consumer behavior, I target that
You impressed with what they wearin', I started that

[Verse 2]
It's kinda terrific, the product of Slick Rick
Somebody woulda told me then I would come outta this shit rich
And start up a business, I woulda thought they was playin'
All them niggas I ran with, all that weight they was weighin'
A light bulb switched in my mind at the classes I cut
Just a spazz, puttin' wax in the blunt
The baddest I want, she wear Lipmatic to front
We building businesses, you can be mad if you want
It's bubbly 'til it's bubbles we see
Drinkin' like Dean Martin is nothin' to me
The spirits is somethin' I can't part and it's fun to be me
So cheers, here's to the Kanye production this eve

Let's make a bet, I know the reason you ain't make it yet
Your stage was set, but you ain't see the tedious ingredients
That go inside of a rider, you hiding from problems and
You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with Black Jason, '89 with a bottle
Niggas jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty, no tint
Rollie on wrist, gleaming, he rock the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Lewis and Halsey
Cop chocolate Thai, Vernon style and burn it down
My nigga Hype in the federal joint, verdict out
Twenty years getting money in the Dirty South
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude
So I'm yelling, ""Free my nigga!""
My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too
For what his hands usually call for, but he ain't do it

Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from
And what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been, where I been

[Verse 2]
You ever been on the other end of a robber's revolver?
Not me, call me Lucky Nas Castellana
Or been shot in the medulla oblongata
And survived and praise God with a bullet I never collided
Some did and they lived, I salute the Gods
Moët spilling, splashed by mistake on my Timb boots for y'all
N.Y. nigga, Adidas, jogging suit
Shell toes, slim, fly nigga
Hudson River, rent a boat, t-shirt with a dinner coat
A vintage Fila like I'm the ghost of Domencio
On any day getting throat in a tinted vehicle
Like a old BK gangsta, but I'm the CEO
Of Nasty Nas Enterprises, mastermind, made men
My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends
Dedication, hard work, routine builds character
In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers
Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it
Break through walls like Pink Floyd
And drink fluids, of all kind of alcohol, y'all
Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes

[Chorus]
Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am
'Cause where I'm from
Man, what I see, you wouldn't understand
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from

Now holla at a millionaire
Rollie, Hublot and Audemar, deciding which one to wear
Who to screw, what to drive
550 with the cream guts inside
Or the Super Sport Range truck is fly
Diamond ring on my knuckles, like fire, bitch
Gats on us, I don't really trust these guys
Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties
If she beautiful, the lustful type, I'll hit it and bust inside
Fuck it, I'ma die one day
They gon' probably make that day a holiday
Until then, let's go on a shopping spree
Speaking for my real niggas
Only OGs, certified who kill niggas
When put in that seat, but tonight we on chill, nigga
Chill mode, spill more Spades
Listen to Yeezy and Hov, some Rozay
It's like we always on the grind with no brakes
So tonight we gon' act like we on vacation with this on rotation

Who you are ain't in the recipe of what I am (word)

Where I been and what I do

Listen up, gangstas and honeys with your hair done
Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog—whatever they call you—God, just listen
I spit a story backwards—it starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in the chest of this nigga
Now he back to square one, screamin', ""shoot don't please""
I put my fifth back on my hip, it's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, ""go he there""
Sittin' in back of this chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt
The blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, ""block your on enemy's the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""no hell,"" she talkin' about, ""me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said]
*Beep*
Ayo son, ayo son, you hear me, you hear me?
Listen, man, this dude right on the block
Right now, man, I found him, right now
I see him right now, let's kill him!
*Beep*
""Yo, this Nas, leave it: peace.""",Nas,Rap
48,A Queens Story,"[Verse 1]
Uhh, rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck
Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you
It’s foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could’ve died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November 30th, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y’all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, eight street, twin buildings
Vernon, can’t even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for DU, say what up to Snacks, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through, uhh...

[Verse 2]
Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team on 118
My nigga Bim fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
(You all know how the story GO!)

[Verse 3]
""Any other real niggas in the world besides us?"" I ask
Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you DU
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real OG 'cause back in '93
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie’s gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now
But you know I'm still mental but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling

[Verse 4]
Watch the calm realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow, fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers, hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling",Nas,Rap
49,World’s an Addiction,"[Intro]
Lies and the pain
Betrayal, life

[Bridge]
In danger’s face
Look what you’re facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn’t ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for

[Refrain]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 1]
Uhh, snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat
Stretched out, letter T, it's better to dead a beef
Than let it breathe, then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squirmish to blood
We can thug and get out of hand; what’s the options?
Only conclusion is shooting, bullets popping, hoodlums dropping
Fear any day that the Feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous, asking myself what’s my purpose?
In the back of a paddy wagon, bracelets aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops can’t relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy

[Refrain]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 2]
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments
Know a billionaire, he has everything but a fam
Guess how angry this man gets
Had so many bad chicks in his bed, strange sex, same sex
Has addictions that are sadistic, chain of events, habits
He puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting, alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he’s into bestiality porn
And it’s wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and baddest cars and condos
Fine clothes and these fiends needs to get high
So they find dough to mainline dope, and y'all know

[Refrain]
The world is an addiction
Serving up a fix
The world is an addiction
It's way too much for me

[Verse 3]
So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life, that's women, that’s cars, cigars
A vintage bottle on ice that’s priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate cause he’s newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation
Calling up his travel agent, same time, premeditating
Murdering his ex wife; life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining

[Outro]
Oooooooooooh-ahhhhhhhhh....
Ahhhhhhhh-ahhhhhh-ahhhhhh...ahhh..
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)

Church and the liquor store crowded
911 is a joke don’t dial it
We ain't really tripping when the money stay piling
Money comin slow then mothafuckas get violent
I just want a crib and a coupe low mileage
Blowing on some dope with a yellow bone stallion
So high, and niggas wanna know why I ride
With semi automatic by my side
Cause I got niggas comin at my head
But I won’t let them bitches stop my bread
A mothafucka wanna short my dough
I hit him twice with the black fo-fo
The witness, courtroom no-show
And what a nigga don’t know, won’t go
‘Dro, hoes and the dope game made me
On the front page magazine, no label
Industry don’t want him cause the nigga’s too gangsta
Probably never heard him on ya radio station
Way too thug for these mothafuckin’ rappers
Rap way better than ya neighborhood trapper
Man came down on the uppity bitch
I be fuckin' the bitch, let my niggas smash right after
Dope in the kitchen gotta get it stretchin' n whippin'
Know some niggas that slippin, we can hit a lick if you with it
Then I ship and deliver, I ain’t took a trip in a minute
Now i’m in the position, I can give it to my lieutenant
Need a mothafucka robbed, I’m the nigga for the job

Breakin' it down for 3 bitches
Duffle stuffed with 3 6’s
Heat under the pillow, I sleep wit' my Mrs

Niggas where I rest possessed to whip chickens
Livin' on ya dick til ya hit the next shipment
So high, and niggas wanna know why I, ride
With semi automatic by my, side
I need a nigga that’s fosho gon' bust
And really I’m the only nigga I, trust
And really I'm the only nigga that, cold
New shoes, Cadillac on vogues
Shine for the dimes and the rat, hoes
Check a pack, write a rap, crack, sold
And my trunk leave cracks in the pavement
Chevy only carry heavy weight, Lord save 'em
Just another victim of the game, can you blame ‘em
And he stay paid, can’t a lame nigga fade 'em
And most of you niggas in the rap game dick blowers
But at the end of the day they don't get shit for it
But me and mine’s gotta eat, so I’m beatin’ up the street
Dinner time, man, I gotta hit a lick for it
Send ‘em to God, tryna rob the godfather
And if you scared of catchin’ a murder then why bother
I’m peelin' off a knock for pots of hot water
Niggas wrote me off and it made me grind harder
Peace to the East, nigga peace to the chief
Got a slug for the judge, bringin' heat for police
And a book full of sins that I reap when I sleep
Then I wake up and I put em on a beat, how you love that?

And these streets they got no mercy on a broke nigga
Gangsta Island, so all my niggas gang bangers
Girls, come get your cook up

And I grew up next door to the dopeman
Cherry red CL coupe clean as a coke can
DEA been doin' surveillance, they in the dope van
Nowadays they pay Walter Payton; that’s 34 bands
Yeah, I’m still livin' like a jack boy
Got your family wrapped up in tape, I’m 'bout the sack, boy
And I heard it ain’t where you from, it’s where you at, boy
Make sure every place that I’m at next to the strap, boy
Killin' them, shit from these verses put hoes in hearses
And these cluckers need some product
To purchase some at their service
Used to sale my yellow and nextel play for the chirpers
Ain’t no doubt, we don’t check out CTE
They close the curtains

Guns and contraband on deck
Street said that I'm marked for death
And might be the one to get smoked next
Might fuck around, might beat it down
That ass round and that throat wet
You a pussy boy, straight Kotex
Got a hundred rounds, bitch, hold that
Bitch, hold that, bitch, hold up
Bitch, know what? That 4 bust
Bought a 14 of that straight hard
And served every geeker that rolled up
That straight trap with no raps with me
OT, but they pack with me
Moonwalkin' on dope, bitch
I know real niggas on Jackson Street
25th, 49th, Cali kush over night
Come back to my store, dawg
But make sure you got your order right
And my shop might close up
So make sure you put your orders in
Just another day another dollar

Pass me my strap

My ambitions as a rider, nigga, survival off that powder, nigga
Currently smokin' that kill in the hills where you can't find a nigga
Crack cocaine, microwave, dinner was on that timer, nigga
No sleep, bags under my eyes is designer, nigga
Blinded and misguided, nigga, Heavenly Father take the wheel
I'm on the interstate with some gorilla weight
Shit that can get me like 200 years
Duckin' the pen', I need forgiveness
I'm livin' like a every decision a sin
I know my niggas don't want me to win
Jealousy, choppin' off all of my friends

[Chorus]
I ride with that white-white, just like fight night we be weighin' in
VVS my pieces, 20 karat Jesus say amen
Tricked off on my new bitch, she was half black and Malaysian
Spent my last 200 thou' on a bird and a Mercedes Benz
My dog used to pull up in a '99 GS-300
Fresh up on the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
First these hoes ain't want it
Now they only here to Michael Jones it (Mike Jones!)
Mama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment

[Verse 2]
Now I-I-I-I be kickin' shit like Solange in the elevator
The goal when you try to kick that dope, stuck on the respirator
Got symptoms of withdrawal from the fall when I used to ball
I show you how in one summer one nigga could lose it all
Like why we gotta feel this pain and her friends and family don't?
My cellie like to walk around in his sleep, I rather stay woke
I must evoke, these are the results of the realest shit that I wrote
These hoes get in your ear and burn that ass quick like Galaxy Notes

[Chorus]
That's why I ride with that white-white, just like fight night we be weighin' in
VVS my pieces, 20 karat Jesus say amen
Tricked off on my new bitch, she was half black and Malaysian
Split my last two hundred thou' on a bird and Mercedes Benz
My dog used to pull up in a '99 GS-300
Fresh up off the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
First these hoes ain't want it
Now they only here to Michael Jones it (Mike Jones!)
Mama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment

Rips from the clip leave you stiff, Mannequin Challenge, nigga
Me and my chips with dip boy, ain't no play play 'bout that Frito-Lay
Tried to give me ten, I beat the case so it's gon' be okay
Fresh up on the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
Mama say I live next door to the death cause I live in the moment

[Outro]
Don't live in the moment
Don't live in the moment
I'll be there in the mornin'

'Cept, ""Fuck a friend, you gon' be solo in your coffin, bitch""
Walkin' home from work, my .44 bulldog what I'm walkin' with
Old folks out the church say, ""He need Jesus, that boy off a bit""
Preacher's daughter said, ""I'll let you fuck, it just might cost a bit""
Type of shit a nigga been through make you dog a bitch
Lost a bitch, married these streets, she prenup, you can't divorce her

Don't blow your money, young nigga, pay your lawyer

Po-po searched my Cutlass on the road, I got my Os hit

Boy you know the rules, that shit don't jump unless you sold it down
S.W.A.T. team break, they cut the water off, can't flush the toilet down

All these bitch niggas got videos up with their toolies out
Everybody flashin' real money
Niggas card crackin', gettin' Visa money
I don't knock it, I just do the dope and blow it
I gotta get it so I gotta see the money

To get the blunt liquor and a piece of money, young nigga

Quit playin' with me
Hit-Boy (Hol' up)

[Chorus]
She keep calling me babe, I said ""That's not my name""
Million dollars, million followers, ho, that's not the same
And I just washed off the chicken, baby, that's not cocaine
Shit's so hot, you got two hundred, you can get like four thangs, yeah

[Verse]
Gangsta G, gorilla pimp, stay with banana
I fuck with Sean Don, he run the D like Barry Sanders
Trophies, mantels, Billups, how shit get handled
I pray my life go over easy and I never scramble
She sent a text like ""Can we talk?"" Bitch, I'm not Tevin Campbell
I walk in, I'm deckin' it, makin' an entrance, I know where the exit is
We kick them hoes out, ain't no room service, we ain't bringing no breakfast in
Got an oval office in my house, bitch suck me off like a president
I'm talkin' Jefferson, Edison, Clinton
So much pussy, look like I'm sellin' it
And the polices know that I'm sellin' it
I did the one and the two with the heroin
And my nigga was snitchin', he tellin' it
I had to jump off a war with the Mexicans
Gotta get me a brand new plug
I run out of dope and I'm out of my element
Yeah, uh, bitch, Google my government, but that's not my name
Million dollars, million followers, ho, that's not the same
And I just washed off the chicken, baby, that's not cocaine, yeah
I give you the game, I don't play for the love of the game
Ho, I play for the rings
Every ho that I got is a side bitch
I ain't never gon' fuck on the main
Better Alex Trebek, I don't answer those questions
Jeopardize how far we done came
We are not one in the same, we can rock the same thing
And it won't look the same
These bitches, they want me to wife 'em, but I just one night 'em
Good bitches, they know me, it's all in my veins

[Chorus]
She keep calling me babe, I said ""That's not my name""
Million dollars, million followers, ho, that's not the same
And I just washed off the chicken, baby, that's not cocaine
Shit's so hot, you got two hundred, you can get like four thangs, yeah

6,How We Do (’93 Til Freestyle #3),"[Intro]
Yeah
Still too cool to love these hoes
All I wanna do is fuck these hoes
Still too cool to love these hoes
All I wanna do is fuck these hoes


[Verse 1]
Once upon a time round '99
I took a chick to the prom with a big behind
She had a cute face, a thin waist, a bright smile
Titties mediocre, but ass was like, blaow
Might have been two thou' when I met that ho
But on the low I used to sweat that ho, I had to let that go
Cause baby had me with a hell of a crush
Love letters on her locker, I ain't give no fuck
What other niggas thought about me
Cause I was all about we, me and her 'til I D-I-E
Made me want to do some shit like carve her name in a tree
Like we was K-I-S-S-I-N-G
But little did I know she had a dude
With hella money, hella jewels, I was just another nigga in school
A straight fool, for thinking I was special or different
Lost my respect for the rest of the bitches
I played hoes and shank hoes for bankrolls
Never thought they'd fill my heart with pain though
I would laugh when a broad made my niggas feel blue
But the jokes ain't funny when the joke's on you
Let me stroke something boo, let me get that pearl
Touch your softest spot, let me in your world
And you can be his girl, and that nigga can remain your man
Freddie G'll be your back-up plan

[Hook] x2
It’s how we do
Cause why have one when a nigga can have two
Three or four hoes I like the ass brand new
Just fuck with me and ill stay true
“I love you""
Yea yea I love you too

It's how we do, do, do-do-do
It's how we do, do, do-do-do
It's how we do, do, do-do-do

[Verse 2]
I had a bad bitch from Nap named Nicole
Nicole used to keep a nigga dick on swole
She knew I had a girlfriend, but she love my pole
And when she saw me with my woman, then she lost control
And went crazy, ""Freddie I can't believe you played me
People told me that niggas from the G was shady
You forgot you didn't wear a rubber when you laid me
I'm pregnant and it's your baby""
Hell of a bind, these hoes put me through a hell of a time
Met a girl last year that I thought was mine
Came all the way to NY to see me rhyme
Flew her ass out to LA for Christmas time
And shit was fine, we on the same beat
She ain't got a problem with me being in the street
I know I ain't her one and only, but I'm hoping I ain't one of many
Baby pretty, but try to play me silly, cause she really
Wasn't think 'bout religion when she told me the dick bomb
But then she up and left me cause I practice Islam
I guess Mom told her that the boy ain't right
And she gon' pray to Jesus Christ to take me out of her life
And out of her sight, she keep it undercover
I really used to mean it when I told her that I love her
But now I know that love is a four letter word
Like fuck and shit
So love you can suck my dick",Freddie Gibbs,Rap

[Verse 1]
The future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
I admit that I was timid at a younger age, nigga
Daddy asked me what I wanna be, I said, ""A paid nigga""
Whippin' extras out the pot, I gave myself a raise, nigga
Heaven sent, I can't remember the last time I prayed, nigga
So the Devil introduced me to cookin' cocaine, nigga
On the blade, seven days, ain't bathe or shave, nigga
I was, thuggin' with my trey-eight
Motherfuck a president, I got a Presidential Day-date
I run a check up like a Chase bank
The police open up the package if your shipment come a day late
I just beat a rape case—groupie-bitch I never fucked
Tried to give me ten for some pussy that I never touched
At a certain level, system tried to test a nigga's nuts
Nigga hire like eleven lawyers—had to level up, yeah

[Chorus]
Living this life, just me, myself and I
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
If I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
Living this life, just me, myself and I
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
And if I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)

[Verse 2]
The future started yesterday nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
Had a baby, now my daughter gettin' up in age, nigga
When I die, I bet she say, ""My daddy was a paid nigga""
'Round the world, jail system like a slave trade, nigga
Got me in this foreign prison, monkey in a cage, nigga
Bail paid, locked me up for an extra 30 days, nigga
Barely let us use the shower, ain't bathed or shaved, nigga
I was, sittin' in a cell missin' show dates
Commissary late, I'm postin' pictures with the toothpaste
Barely eat the food, stress'll make a nigga lose weight
Enter the mental of a nigga that wish he knew his fate
Shit these bitches do to try to get your cash
Erica visit, can't wipe her tears from behind the glass
Choppin' the porcelain up for years, said I'm suckin' glass
I beat the DEA and the task, now I'm on my ass
Future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
Donald Trump gon' chain us up and turn back to slaves, nigga
Got the recipe for dope, my reparations paid, nigga
Feel like that at some point, really I should feel ashamed, nigga
They kill us, we killin' us, but that is not the way, nigga
Money tree up in the stripper club, I'm throwin' shade, nigga
Did destruction on your flow when I paved the lane, nigga
Chest to chopper, blow your chest out, where your heart at, nigga?
Black Tony, Babyface, better scar that nigga
Sent the hit out, I'm just waitin' on the call back, nigga
Shoot them pussies, burn it up, don't bring the car back, nigga
Gangsta G, I fucked the industry, them crackers say I'm too aggressive
I turned myself into a boss without a fuckin' question
Six whips, ghetto nigga gotta be excessive
I came up on fried bologna, boy, what you expected?
What you expected?

Living this life, just me, myself and I
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
If I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright

And if I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright

Rob me a nigga
Rob me a, rob me a nigga
Cause the bills too high, this nigga right here too fly
And right now I just might rob me a nigga

[Verse 1 - Freddie Gibbs]
The liquor got me lurking and looking for a lame nigga
To set up for my next lick
In the Chevy, about to roll up the stress, with a Tec
And what he got on his neck, got him a death wish
It's kinda funny cause he used to be my nigga tho
We was breaking bread, flipping bricks like a year ago
Shit can get into a nigga's head when his digits low
Make you wanna send one of your friends to his funeral
Maybe me and him was never friends in the first place
Don't mean a thing cause we share the same birthplace
Same city, same hood, but we down to kill each other for a dollar
Cause we want it in the worst way
Money talk and bullshit gon walk a marathon
And I ain't scared of getting killed cause I'm getting mine
And if they ever try to raid, I'mma hit the fuckin pigs with the K's
I ain't tryna do a lick of time
Spend all my last money, the bills too high
His jewelry, his whip game, the wheels too fly
I'm thinking about murder every time we cruise by
Heard he got like 84 elbows of blue fire
In the basement, muthafuckas still think basic
Thinkin' I'mma show up and erase 'em, but I ain't gonna chase 'em
I'mma be up in his crib waiting
""Bitch where the cash? I can taste it""
Put em on their faces]
As I look at the charm, thinking of a strong arm
Seen his watch as he reachin for his car alarm
Bet this hundred round drum pussy nigga thinkin twice
Fore he try to run, shots spit, and the cops come
All they seen was my golds and a black mask
Throw the car round the corner, tinted up with no tags
All these niggas wanna flash, Ima put it to they ass
With the K out, ask a nigga, “Where da sack at?""
Give it here, you wanna die for that rolex?
You can either get your life or that watch back
Ima shoot you point blank, I’m just hoping you think
You can take it as a loss, you can get it back
Nigga, buck and get shot, that’s the street code
I’m leave you there, do you, that’s how the shit go
Just another episode, A-K explode
In his head, left a smoke hole
Be a shamed if you died over fake shit
But that’s a lesson, if you out here on some fake shit
Come and robbin everyday, know the young nigga hungry
They be murkin for a quarter brick
Know they kill a whole fam for the whole thang
All the shooters up in Gary on the same thang
All the little homies strapped, so they look plain
Gun shots rang out, nigga, see flames
We be takin so much, now the shit fun
We be lookin for your shit fore your shit come
Forty eight hours, nigga round my way
Everyday nigga lookin like a sitcom
In this game of lose or draw nigga
You can be the one that get robbed
Or be the one to rob a nigga
But we all gotta eat, so we get no sleep
We gon wait it out and kill a nigga",Freddie Gibbs,Rap

Fuck it, I'ma bust a fuckin' jugg, I'm a juggernaut
Pop a zone and drop it off in that water, we was cookin' out
Loud packs and molly powder all these niggas pushin' out
Feds lookin', cause I peddled paint to these poor folks
The realest niggas that I know ain't never sold dope
The hardest niggas that I know ain't never served time
Soon as I got me thirty thousand, I hit the bird line
And I brought that dog back to the set, niggas know me for that
Shout out to my niggas from D.C. with them scorpion packs
Keep this strictly business, you can't mix up your homie with that
One day you might have to clap a nigga, no glory in that
Feel like I'm outgrowin' all my friends, niggas thinkin' small
Gon' have to write them all a check, just to get the shit resolved
Then turn right back around and write them another one when they trick it off
Get successful and watch how quickly niggas get in their feelings, dawg
Get successful and watch how you immediately become their competition
Niggas worse than a side bitch, they can't quite stay in a position
Don't know what niggas crave more, money or a-fuckin-ttention
And these the niggas I'm cool with, my enemies I have yet to mention

[Chorus]
I got cake, bitch, everyday be my birthday
You can't take me, I'm first place on my worst day
Streets dry, niggas thirsty, so I pray that when they come and take me
That this mini Draco make the earth shake
Have a nigga on some ""underneath the earth""shit
My nigga Shermie caught a murder on his first lick
These animalistic instincts that we was born with
Felt so pimpish when Alexys put me in the foreign whip
Black as hell but rap got me thinkin' I need a foreign bitch
Takin' my black queens for granted, got me ignorin' them

[Verse 2]
Names I be callin' her, nigga know you be doggin' her
What kind of man is you to you little niece and yo' daughter and 'em?
I’m posted at the stove with that yola, that soda lockin' in
Ving Rhames guns and butter, niggas get margarine
Pussy niggas can't play they part, we dearly departed them
Quick like OJ Simpson, you Bart, Homer, and Marge and 'em
I rap but I keep weight, and I know the streets take
Niggas out the game, my baby momma told me be safe
Turned around and said, ""Fuck safe, I stay dangerous""
In the set with Sodi, no chopper, my chain danglin'
In the set with Deuce, I be Bloodin', we gang gangin' 'em
My nigga Corleone and Diego, they smash craniums
Livin' life on high speed, nigga, that's just the lane we in
'Bout to cop a Porsche from that the packet that Freddie Kane gettin'

[Chorus]
I got cake, bitch, everyday be my birthday
You can't take me, I'm first place on my worst day
Streets dry, niggas thirsty, so I pray that when they come and take me
That this mini Draco make the earth shake
Have a nigga on some ""underneath the earth"" shit
My nigga Shermie caught a murder on his first lick
These animalistic instincts that we was born with
Felt so pimpish when Alexys put me in the foreign whip
Black as hell but rap got me thinkin' I need a foreign bitch
Takin' my black queens for granted, got me ignorin' them",Freddie Gibbs,Rap
14,Eastside Moonwalker,"[Verse 1]
Lifestyles of the insane
Eastside thug nigga, I'm the shit, you a shit stain
I let the boxframe switch lanes
Not a pretty nigga, but I got some game for a bitch brain
And I lay it on so thick
Charge it all to a broad, heard a pimp nigga quote this
And I'm allergic to a broke bitch
I think I need my medicine, I had to po' up 'fore I wrote this
And doing dirty keep a nigga with a deep pocket
Dope fiends and the cluckheads keep shopping
Steady praying that the yayo keep locking
Keep a strap cause the jackboys keep robbing
Got me pulling up slow
Whip another clip and put my pedal to the floor
Slamming Cadillac doors, working wood like a pro
Ass sit on nothing but that leather, whatcha know, how you living, nigga?
Lifestyles of the insane
Roll the kill, pop a pill, crack a seal, I resist pain
Niggas looking for that big stain
Dirt weed, dog food, fye kush, niggas flip 'caine
Think I lost my religion
Stepping on a pack, break 'em off in the kitchen
Chevy topped off with the chrome in the engine
Niggas gotta floss, that's the cost of this pimping, I'ma pull up slow

[Hook]
I'ma pull up slow
Candy paint dripping from my Cadillac door
I'ma pull up slow, I'ma pull up slow
Run up with the mask, put them hoes on the floor
I'ma pull up slow, I'mma pull up slow
Run up with the mask, put them hoes on the floor
I'ma pull up slow, I'ma pull up slow
Candy paint dripping from my Cadillac door
I'ma pull up slow

[Verse 2]
It's the muddy cup moonwalker, nightstalker
Motherfucking white chalker, might've caught ya
In the streets with your pants down
Tell 'em call the paramedics, nigga man down, ease up
If you thugging, get your Gs up
And never fake, never fraud, never fold, never freeze up
A black mask, black tee'd up
The motherfucking dope game feed us, how you living, nigga?
And rest in peace to my motherfucking homeboy
But hold your tears, he ain't die, he just a fuckboy
You might as well be a dead man in my eyes
2-2-3, sucker-free when I ride
Freddie Kane, Freddie Corleone
Selling things to the smokers in the mobile homes
A pack of backwoods, dirty styrofoam, and a pocket full of stones
And my Cadillac Brougham, I'ma pull up slow

15,The Hard,"[Intro]
I know that life is short
But we can't move too fast

[Verse 1]
Hit the block, dressed in white, straight Bo Jackson Nikes
Call my partner Mike, copped a pint, pour four in my Sprite
55 a line, that's aight cause I'm 'bout that life
Pussy on my mind, bitch you tired, it's that mouth tonight
Weed and waffles in the morning
Downtown Chicago, smoking on some shit that I imported
MDMA light up her day, sometimes she like to snort it
And shit was too dry with that Tony, bitch now I'm reloaded
Bitch I'm reloaded
And I'm chopping up the hard, dopeboy I play my part
Fuck with the gangsta type, ain't got no stripes, then you's a mark
Smoking Carolina Blue fresh out the Carolina Park
So much gunplay in the day, just might be safer in the dark
And this Glock ain't got no safety, the owner ain't got no patience
So please don't make my finger and this trigger make relations
Said this Glock ain't got no safety, straight make yo ass a patient
Guess I'll slang until my grave or take that federal vacation

[Bridge]
Whip the crack, dressed in black, just picked up a pack
Feeling great, dropped some 28s, got 'em jumping back
Jumping up, what the fuck, G.I. they don't fuck with us
Most these niggas out the Mid wouldn't breathe until I bust a nut

[Verse 2]
Rob a nigga father figure, dope house was my college nigga
Plus my part time job didn't make no dollars, I'm a water whipper
See through you like windows, basis of your heart is artificial
Mob of hungry niggas like we came straight out of Mogadishu
What's the issue? Stack full of pancakes and my pistol
Shit official, when you see a police, nigga hit that whistle
They out to get you, so fuck all my opponents
They can peel me off this corner cause I know these niggas want it

[Hook]
These niggas want it so I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard
These niggas say they want it so I'm chopping up the hard
Said I'm chopping up the hard, I'm chopping up the hard

[Verse 3]
I know that life is short
(Life's short, know what I'm saying, you gotta get moving, know what I mean)
But we can't move too fast
(Know what I'm saying, I ain't tryna run a race or no shit like that, you know)
Cause if we go right now
(Nigga just tryna get out here and chop, chop it up and get mine, you know
Piece of the pie)
It will never last

When the sun comes up
And everything is cold
It's a new day

Yeah, for sure nigga
We came from nothing nigga, from shit nigga
For real

[Verse]
Dolo and the pour up
Got me tore up from the floor up
Gang signs, gang handshakes every time a nigga show up
All the real niggas know us
Back in '09, me and Lam, we was looking for a way out
But ain't nobody want to show us
Riding 'round, selling blow, shotgun doors out his Volvo
Must have sowed a whole O up
And you stuck it out with me, I love you like a brother
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have no rap career or nothing
I know you hate the fact that I'm so loyal to my street affiliation
But my niggas need a pack, I'm out here thuggin'
Willie and Diego need a pack, I'm out here thuggin'
My nigga Butter hit me for a pack, I'm out here thuggin'
And now the DEA, they checkin' on me when I'm gettin on a plane
Double life, it got me ducking undercovers
I just want to be legit man, shit man
And every time I touch the dope, I say that this gon' be my last flip man
I got a shorty that's willing to sell it for me
She my lover, my homie, the devil cursed me with a pimp hand
I hope my daughter never lives this type of lifestyle
Creeping under streetlights as a night child
My uncle still can't put the liquor or the pipe down
Meanwhile I'm in this kitchen whipping up the white gal
Plus I got addictions of my own, boy
The pills into laced blunts got me gone, boy
The Oxycontin and heavy syrup got me looking in the mirror
Saying, ""Is you a dope fiend or a dope boy?""
Smoking on some shit that I can't pass to a nigga
Eyes shiny than a bitch, glass to a nigga
Down to kick in the door, .44 mags to a nigga
Got some habits I pray that I never pass to a nigga
All about the dollar signs, fuck the sympathy
And fuck police cause they killing you and killing me
Slanging and banging, my paper stay getting fatter
So do black lives matter when you 'bout to kill your enemy?
I need to know it, drop that paper boy don't be heroic
You'll get a trip to see your Jesus if you're reaching for it
A real solid street nigga, never been extorted
You pussy niggas shouldn't be living, should have been aborted

Beat the cake just like Ikey beat Anna Mae
I don't got shit for a pussy ass nigga
But white shit and yellow tape
I don't got shit for a pussy ass nigga
But knuckles and hollow tips
I just put my monkey nuts on my chopper stick
Might just knock of an arm when that chopper hits
Front my cousin the pack and he just lost a brick
Cut that nigga off like he a naggin' bitch
Got my house and my whip and your bitch
And this drip on my neck and my wrist off that powder shit

Benz fully automatic, chopper fully automatic
She gon' suck me off, it's automatic

Gang gang got it tatted
Set name got it tatted
Yayo got me fuckin' with the matics
Finna wrap this crack up in the plastic
Sent your bitch to shop in London
Seven-hour flight, the ho ain't bring no baggage
Street sweeper got a heatseeker
Push a pussy nigga off the planet (on God)
Oh God, show you niggas how to rob
I can shoot a nigga in the face and make the bond
Knock him out his Louboutins
Over 500 degrees when I cook a nigga
Fuck polices
I go on the run 'fore I just let 'em book a nigga
Cop that new GTR or Porsche
That's the garage on you pussy niggas

Niggas foundation is shaky, ain't shit to stand on
A man's born with the only guarantee to live and die
But will I die before I live, 'fore I begin to fly?
Nigga, I can't deny when I'm not high, I miss that rush, that shit be callin' me
Demons never rest, I go to sleep, them bitches follow me
I just bought a AR for my dog, he walked the dog for me
Breakfast and promethazine with Ocean Spray and broccoli
Chase these hoes and I act like I can't keep these bitches off of me
They only fuckin' a nigga that got the most dollars in your squadary
I went to visit my nigga, he caught him a charge, his cards was fraudulent
Time to go get me some yayo, I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
That Bentley, Benz or Beamer, shippin' B's, I don't be in it
Not to let these bitches see me in it, fuck a ceilin'
Nigga wanna be me, even Steve could see the G in him
She work in the mornin', get that pussy in the PM then
I get in it then I jetted, it was a fly by, red bottoms, the thigh high
And every time she see me, she's sayin' ""I don't know why I
Fuck with niggas like you 'cause at first, you would play the shy guy""
Give me that pussy once and I always got it like the Wi-Fi, bitch
I went to visit my nigga, he caught him a charge, his cards was fraudulent
Time to go get me some yayo, I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
I remember when Dukie lost his arm in fuckin' armed robbery
When I seen his shit was danglin', almost felt my heart stoppin' G
Stop it G, drop it G, so much weed, forgot to breathe
Some niggas take the trip I took, but they don't get to leave
Came out that bitch, I'm speakin' Russian, German, Guapanese
Can't let these niggas stunt my growth from livin' for my seed

Level up, I'm on a stage, I gotta get paid
I can never be a slave for minimum wage
Cop an ounce up off the way, you fill 'em with K's
Level up, I'm on a stage, I gotta get paid

I been tryna fuck her for a month, but she ain't on shit
Start to make a nigga feel like I DM'd the wrong bitch
Skip the introduction, I just hit her with the long dick
Tried to drop the 50 pointer and I get my phone lit
Niggas looking for the, for the... shit
Niggas always talkin' 'bout their bitches ain't shit
Caught a charge, my baby mama, she was solid as a brick
All the niggas I was feedin', they ain't give a nigga shit
Momma always told me ""Nigga, go and get your own shit""

We cheat death with each breath
The only one who make it last forever is Keith Sweat
You ever see a body lyin' dead in the streets yet
Then eat breakfast? Swallow forced beliefs like police justice
If my city is like yours
Then serials scratched, fingerprints is wiped off
If people seem to always have somethin' to fight for
But still end up in the state pen or the psych ward, it's lights off
They catch so many casualties, it's like war
That's the reason I don't believe in the hype y'all
The devil talkin' 'bout he wanna extradite y'all
Now I'm the nigga they shinin' the searchlight for

Homie showed me a nine milli and nine nickel

Cousin got her lights and her gas cut last week
How that make me look if I don't help her get up on her feet?
She keep a different nigga, now she in there pregnant every week
I pray you take these devils out our life, Lord, that's on Vice Lord
Baby mamas come with their drama, made her my wife, Lord

Yo, my memoirs are like the Anarchist's Cookbook
Meets the Tom Ford spring/summer look book
Some people wanna see me hanging from a good hook
Instead I hang with a language and slang in
The anguish and pain fit as well cause it came with us
After all these years carrying this shame with us
Now the entire planet is going insane with us
Seven year old kids carrying flame spitters
Fortified fences, mortify senses
Crossfire missed my little daughter by inches
Chemical dependence, medical expenses
But no amount of money on earth can buy vengeance
Writing a life sentence, sirens, fire engines
Tyrants seen through the eyes of the wide lenses
Senseless crimes cause some of us want to drive Benzes
But are you tryna ride with us or against us?

[Outro]
As long as they kill us
And go to Wendy’s and have a burger and go to sleep
They gon' keep killing us
But when we die and they die
Then soon we gon' sit at a table, and talk about it, we tired
We want some of this earth
Or we'll tear this goddamn country apart!

Got dope in the attic, I'm in the ceiling with the yay

Smoke alarm going off, popo knocking on my do', oh

Green leaf stoner, real weed smoker
Wanna kick it with me, you better bring weed over
I got too many problems, ain't no need to be sober
But I ain't really waiting on you niggas to split it
Roll it and hit it cause I've already got me some
Roll another nigga, I'm hardly done
Kray Jack got Bob Marley lungs
I hit a little bit of Snoop OG kush
Then I roll up some Wiz Khalif to get a hook
It's sticky icky nigga, trust it be real
Cause I planted it and grew it on Cypress Hill
Bud smokers only, bud smokers only, on-ly
Don't ask if I'm high

She rolled up a sack of that, purp
The mystical haze got her going in a maze
While she twerkin and workin slow motion - I am the potion
That will dwell inside the magical purp that you inhale
Inside your mind as I, seduce your brain cells
You gotta get high 'til you can't tell
If you in heaven with the angels
Playing my music and get high to it
It's hypnotizing like a brain spell
Real nigga smoking on purple trees
All about money, gotta count this green
Mackin these bitches and I'm gettin to the riches
And yo bitch love smoking me
When the beat break down (break down)
Get lost to the sound (to the sound)
Roll the window down (down)
Let her see the kush clouds (kush clouds)
Ride around through the town (town)
Nigga let the wind blow (wind blow)

Sitting back, getting my dick sucked by the neighborhood ho
East side local 304, stay twisted off that reefer smoke
Stay twisted off them potent pills, might just taste the powder back
Candy nose, man I ran these hoes in a white Range Rove', 'bout to pound her back
No strings attached, bitch might be a ho but she my homie though
She got that friendly pussy, when I touch down she let my homies scope
Preacher's daughter, choir every Sunday bitch you known to blow
When I was on the block broke back in '04, bitch act like she ain’t know me though
But it's all to the good, baby I forgive ya, hoes caught up in the hype
See the chrome shine bright, and now they think I'm they type of nigga
Bitch pump your brakes, you wanna make the bed shake, get dressed and I might come get ya
This ain't a date and never hesitate, you can put your lips where you like while I light my swisha
""Fred you so cold on a ho,"" I know but I just sit back and get chose
All about my stacks fuck a rat bitch I’m gon' stay on ten toes
Got doctors, models, college freaks, and broads on strip poles
When I'm tipping in the G, gotta smoke one with my neighborhood ho

Man, sometimes I like to kick it with them neighborhood hoes
Get drunk and puff a swisha with them neighborhood hoes

I'm riding around and I'm getting it
You riding around and you didn't
I am riding around with semis, life's a bitch so I pimp it
Bread long like Pippen, Gucci on, not Dickies
I will dick her down so quickly
I draw pistols with no pencils
You know what I'm here for, that's to get dough
Hotter than six niggas in a Pinto with the vents closed
Period, menstrual, sentimental bimbos
Telling me they love me but been with all my kinfolks
Want a slice like Kimbo, ice like igloo
I like a girl that like doing what her friend do
'Specially if it's me and I'm laying in the middle
And all my verses cold, my microphone should wear a trenchcoat
Trapping at the Citgo, yea the Citgo
Now I'm the shit, I remember when I was piss poor
Neighborhood hoes still hanging in the neighborhood
And I don't have to talk too much cause my paper do it

Used to sell bud at the village
Knew a lotta killers since they was small
East 17th, Virginia St invented me
Constructed the kid into a crook, look up my history
I looked up to the niggas with Lexuses and Infinitis
Corrupted in correctional facilities
Cause me I'm from the
The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto ghetto
And to make it out where I'm from yes you gotta do something special
Especially when we stressed in these economic conditions
Traditionally causing us to cook a rock in the kitchen
Get it flippin'
Get it jukin' and jumpin' like Earl Manigault

The hustlas they gon' get raided
Eventually, but for now they stay thuggin' and motivated
Misguided miseducated
We barely be graduated
And our lack of skills lead to some daily infatuations
In the ghetto, the barrio, the hood, the slums
Government funds fill my city up with drugs and guns
And I can't go for being broke so I'mma go on the run
Momma can't stand the way I live but can't give up on her son

Convicted felons equippin' tools, all in my shows

They look at me in disbelief when I rhyme about peace
I had people try to deceive me just to see me deceased
My policy is fuck police till all my niggas released
Speak!
The way I'm feelin' my anthem for ghetto children
Fill my daily appetite for destruction I want rebuildin'
Rest in peace to Lil' Ebony, Richardson lord we livin' crazy
It's hard to cope when these cowards is killin' babies

Please yourself or please your homies, man, what's harder to do?
Did some things in life I know I don't want my daughter to do
Shit, got a list of things I don't want my daughter to do
On the blade, tryna get paid, choppin' hard with the crew
Type of shit I did to make me feel a part of the crew
'Til I cut my niggas off, now I'm apart from the crew
I'm playin' my own so I cannot play all positions for my niggas
They hate me, pocket watchin', they got me distant from my niggas
Shit's so fake this days, I got's to keep a pistol around my niggas
Got me on some Grayson Allen shit, I'm trippin' on my niggas
Lord, Chevy dookie blue, on them 22's
Cali pack will send them bitches through, let them bitches move
Everyday I take a couple Qs, serve that after school
Momma take my money, yeah, that's cool but she don't approve

I ain't seen my nigga since I came home
Thought it'd be bottles and bitches right when I came home
Found out my problems was bigger right when I came home
Police 'cross the street takin' pictures right when I came home (snitch nigga)
I can't keep a bitch 'cause I can't feel the love
They always say there was somethin' there when there never was
I donate money to children, but I'm still sellin' drugs
Yeah, I get that yol' for the low-low but was I really plug?
Life was off my mental wasn't plugged in
Every day I pray to Lord, Allah don't snatch my plug out
Stay off the phone, ain't no service up in this drug house
Smell too strong to hit Sunday service, I'm shippin' drugs out
I ain't seen my nigga since I came home
Guess he somewhere gettin' that paper, he can't pick up the phone
Wish him the best, leave him 'lone and let him stay in his zone
And once he fall the fuck off then fuck him, he on his own

Just sat in the cell, ten thousand miles away from my child, for my niggas
It's when I realized I gotta start livin' for my child, and not my niggas, know what I'm sayin'?
I remember not havin' nothin' to read in the cell for a whole month you know what I mean?
The fuckin' guards took me to the library and all the books was in German and shit, you know what I'm sayin', nigga?
That almost broke me down you know
Erica flew all the way over there
Brought a nigga some books, know what I'm sayin'?

Through all the bullshit, all my bullshit she held me down
I love her for that

Such an evil seed, wonder what will my son or daughter be?
Killers
I'm too crazy, ain't fit to raise 'em
Streets might send yo daddy off on vacation or early grave him
Asked my pastor, is there some special place in heaven for gangsters?
In the eighth grade I was selling eight-balls off that pager, put it on my nation
I'm done living out my shoebox
Crack rock cooking on two pots
Came up in the school of the ski mask
Where you quick to make a punk bitch move out
I'm raised way deep on the east side
Right next to the Dorie Miller projects
GDs, Vice Lords on the same set
Wear ya hat the wrong way, you get popped at
And I got a hundred round drum on the AK
Killed a nigga and his homeboy the same day
Now I'm looking for the third motherfucker cause I burn motherfuckers in the rap game same way
And the label never gave no fucks
Tell 'em only thing that dropped was these nuts
Thinking that I'm playing with niggas cuz I don't cater to niggas
I just be taking from niggas and I be waiting for niggas to get

If you gangsta and you know it nigga, stack ya' bands
Whether you knee-deep in them kilos or you sacking grams
This life we live, man, it's so cutthroat make you clap your friends
No ambulance, they just took their bodies in matching vans
Please call the coroner, left some trash on my corner, bruh
I was on tour for the summer, every bitch I fucked was a foreigner
And your bitch was a bust it, met the whole click, fucked, and recorded her
Got some top at the Marriot, dropped her off in the morning
Girl, my morning cup of coffee is a double cup of syrup
Don't take orders from no nigga, fuck your boss and fuck the world
And I'm good in every hood, don't need no passes or referral
Me and crack go way back like starter caps and jheri curls
Whip it girl

I grew up wishing my life would be like the Cosbys
I go that extra mile to escape this ghetto monotony
See how this vicious cycle could fuck wit you psychologically
You best cooperate with the state or become they property
Bitch my name be ringing bells from the street to the jailhouse
And it ain't no transaction unless I came wit my scale out
Roll in yo college, I just might fuck up and fail out
Fucking bitch after bitch, stacking my chips, all I care bout
Fuck a GPA, bitch I need a CPA, come and count it up
Thousand thugs be always tryna catch him in a crowd around the bus
Guess it's bout to go down, if you down to fuck, then you down wit us
I know hoes that won't smoke, but stay sloppy drunk and get powdered up
This Corporate Thug World, they like you but they love the realest
Straight Gary gangsta shit, didn't come up off no fucking gimmicks, bitch
2Pac ain't back cuz he got set up and shot in the chest
Biggie ain't either, so won't y'all gon let them niggas rest?

I'm 187 proof, streets or the fucking booth

You know who you fucking with? A nigga who got shit to lose
I got niggas that rob you and rape yo bitch if they in the mood
Check my record, I been a fool, semi autos all in my locker
Flow stupid like I rode the bus to school with Waka Flocka

And I miss my dude, wishin I could still be with my dude
I'd give it all up to get him back I swear to god
All the money, cars and expensive jewels
Yeah I smoke, I chief, I blaze
Just to ease the stress and pain

43,National Anthem (Fuck the World),"[Verse 1]
Back when I was younger
Very ambitious but often blinded by my hunger
Some say I dream too big
And my dream gon' take me under
Beneath the streets of Gary
Would I make it out, I wonder
Could my obituary be the next they read amongst the
Niggas I came up with and fell victim to this dope game
Poverty stricken so our economy is cocaine
Ecstacy, heroin, marijuana ain't no hope man
Absentee fathers and dope fiend mamas
Got my hood turned out to the point that a nigga wanna go and get paid
Fuck sittin' on the bench I'mma go on
To the next lick til I'm goin' in my grave
Then I figured after that I could make a livin'
Off makin' words rhyme it was all in my mind
Everybody in the G went to Finger Roll studio
Nobody had a flow quite like mine
But along with the fame came a whole lot of
Hate from the hood, everyday I would fight
Mama can't sleep cause I'm way to deep in the streets
She would pray through the night
Every rhyme that I spit's real shit
Cause its just another day in my life
Niggas better keep a vest test to my testicles
They be vegetables, they gonna respect the flow 'til I'm gone

I built my name with no features or some expensive budget
Go for mine cause a co-sign can't coincide with the shit I'm bustin
You see more clear when your pockets start to see that reduction
See how true your crew is, never new they was frontin'
And I bet a nigga told you, that whatever
You go through, we got your back 'til the end
When I came upon a deal, niggas that I never knew
I could blew, wanna come be my friends
Then the boy got dropped and the friendship stopped
In a flash I was back on my own
Put a strap on my lap and the stash in the back
Cause the fact I was wrappin them stones
Got back to the rap cause its all that
I got in the mid west streets be my voice
I dont think another dude could do what I do
So it seem like I ain't got no choice
Then the hoes gon' choose the dudes that come through
Get them groovin and get that shit moist

Nigga pick up the phone, nigga
I just got back from back from Australia
You woulda loved this shit, it was hella hoes, nigga
Hella bitches, I stacked my bread up though, nigga
I think I'mma get this ring for Erica though, my nigga
Yeah, I think she the one
I want you to be the best man and shit my nigga, for real
Hit me when you get back my nigga

[Bridge]
Tell the streets I've been down for a minute
Chop it up and let my real niggas finish
Had the kitchen or the stove, pockets on swole
Choppin' up them O's, I was gettin' it on the road

[Hook]
I was ready for whatever man
I remember I was sellin' things
I let it go, I let it go
Said I was ready for whatever man
With some niggas, they don't ever change
I let it go, I let it go

[Verse 1]
Yeah, Cadillacs, Impalas, nigga we ride Vogues
This for you pussy ass niggas and you weak ass hoes
I candy coat it, triple dip it, nigga, three times gold
Dippin' through traffic, smoking dope like I don't see 5-0
License suspended, I was livin' ignorant
Careful blocking, pop some shots just to impress my niggas
Insecure about my looks, wouldn't pop it with the bitches
Rob and stole for diamond jewels, I thought I needed attention
Why I was starvin' for attention? All she want is my attention
All I wanna do is smoke and fuck her, thug it out and keep shit undercover
Told myself that I would never love her
But I cuss her out, blow up her phone and get mad if another nigga touch her
Insecure and in my motherfuckin' feelings
Thought that I was chasin' money, I was chasin' bitches
But when the Lord gave me my daughter, helped me paint the picture
Man all the shit I did, I'm blessed the streets ain't take a nigga
Nigga I stay

[Hook]
Ready for whatever man
And some niggas, they don't ever change
I let it go, I let it go
And I remember I was sellin' things
I was ready for whatever man
I let it go, I let it go

[Verse 2]
Bentleys and Beamers, Impalas, Caprices
I scope up Diego, my nigga, we beepin'
My day one, we gang bang, we run off, we throw weight
I murder for my dogs, we eat off the same plate
We masked up, all my niggas masked up
Did a show in Brooklyn, niggas tried to get me blast up
Thought you was my nigga, hate to see me get my cash up
Then some niggas hit me, hollows almost tore my ass up
Your shooters was some actors, actin' ass niggas
Scared to squeeze the trigger, some amateur ass niggas
Used to hit the road and get stacks of them cash with them
Only time'll let me know you a stab in the back nigga

[Hook]
I remember we was sellin' things
I came to you, I'd do whatever man
I let it go, I let it go
And I was ready for whatever man
I remember I was sellin' things
I let it go, I let it go
Said I was ready for whatever man
But some niggas, they don't ever change
I let it go, I let it go, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cadillacs, Impalas, nigga, we ride Vogues
Fuck you pussy ass niggas and you weak ass hoes
I candy coat it, triple dip it, nigga, three times gold
Dippin' through traffic, smoking dope like I don't see 5-0
License suspended, I was livin' ignorant
Kept a Glock and, pop some shots just to impress my niggas
Insecure about my looks, wouldn't pop it with the bitches
Rob and stole for diamond jewels, I thought I needed attention
Why I was starvin' for attention? All she wanted is my attention
Fuck you bitches, all my daughter want is my attention
All she want is my attention, yeah
So why am I starvin' for attention?
All she want is my attention, hmm
Why am I starvin' for attention?

I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

[Verse 2]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Chorus]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert (Yeah)

Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster

[Outro]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Head home)
I, I crossed the limelight (No, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

Oh, no longer am afraid of the night

When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'

5,New Slaves,"[Intro]
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill

[Verse 1]
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that ""Don't touch anything in the store""
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that ""Come in, please buy more""
""What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

[Bridge]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2]
I throw these Maybach keys, I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves, I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves, I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me, want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation, y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves, I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out, I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free, you niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me, you know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys, fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves, y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye, y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country so you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters, so I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up, they tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison, get your peace today
They prolly all in the Hamptons, braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house, I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse and in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up, I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out, now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
'Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
Too high again, too high, ooh hoo-hoo-hoo, woo

We could've, ugh, we could've been somebody

He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant-ated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz, you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that
That go into that, all that money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh

Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it

Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas

Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me

'Cause you could blame me for everything

If one day, you just up and leave

So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning

My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours

[Verse 1]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy""

Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

[Verse 2]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

[Bridge]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-

Please, no more parties in L.A. (Shake that body, party that body)
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh (Shake that body, party that body)

Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A

Let me tell you, I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star

13,Real Friends,"[Verse 1]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

[Bridge]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

[Chorus]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 2]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)
Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)
Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
Cause everybody got 'em that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

[Verse 3]
Lookin' for real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin (Yeah yeah)
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, ""What's up, fam? Hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good, I'm great,"" the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Chorus]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I

Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Verse 3]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me, through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in

Well, I found me, oh, Jesus
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild

[Chorus]
And I need you now
Lost and found out

You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
Ay, I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said, ""Baby, what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin' before you met your husband?""
Then I said, ""What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph, around hella thugs?""
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves
(What if Mary) ""What if Mary
(Was in the club) Was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?""
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
(And she was) We surrounded by
(Surrounded by) The fuckin' wolves",Kanye West,Rap
15,I Love Kanye,"[Verse]
I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called ""I Miss The Old Kanye""? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye [Laughter]",Kanye West,Rap

Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side

And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind

No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what we had in mind
But maybe some day

But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store

[Verse 1]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life, homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us

So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, ""Back in my day""
But homie, this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight, man, holla, then

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

I could do this all day, boy, I'm finna turn this bitch out
They need that Ye in the streets, boy, there's been a mothafuckin' drought
Don't really matter what I make, boy, you know I still go wild
Like a light-skinned slave, boy, we in the mothafuckin' house!
Right now, you lookin' real sus right now
I swear I've been on this flight like a month right now
Stupid niggas gettin' money, Forrest Gump right now
Shout-out to Jackie Chan, I need to stunt right now
They've been lookin' at the Gram, I've been lookin' at the Grammys
Like, huh, that's us right now
24/7, 365 days, everybody gettin' paid
Niggas lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJs
People saying, ""Ye, Ye, take it easy""
20 Gs for the Yeezys off of eBay
Niggas do the most and they ain't done shit
Only way I can sum it up, sumbitch

[Bridge]
(Hands up, hands up, hands up)
Hands up, hands up, hands up
So won't you dance? ayy, ayy ayy ayy

I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed

24,Gorgeous,"[Chorus]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of autumn
All them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Chorus]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 2]
Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it

[Chorus]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 3]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls

[Chorus]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 4]
Ayy, yo
I done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black Dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Chorus]
Not for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down",Kanye West,Rap
25,Hold My Liquor,"[Intro]
I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Chorus]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas, they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Verse]
Bitch, I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch, you don't even know us
""Baby girl, he's a loner""
""Baby girl, he's a loner""
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
""When it's over it's over""
And bitch, I'm back out my coma

[Refrain]
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh, I wanna phone home

I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas, they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga

26,Dark Fantasy,"[Intro]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered-down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen

[Chorus]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murciélago
That's me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Mi no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato? (You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

[Chorus]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

[Chorus]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Bridge]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Chorus]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Can we get much higher? (So high)

Uh
Uh
I love it, though
I love it, though, huh, you know?

[Chorus]
Uh, put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, ""This what you really wanted, huh?""
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

[Chorus]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 2]
When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's ""Dior Homme,"" not ""Dior, homie""
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?

[Chorus]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)

My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning

I am a God
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants

Yeah, 9:08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Verse 1]
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

[Chorus]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, ""How my neck look?""
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (Real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow

Please face me when I speak
Please say to me somethin' before you leave
You've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you
Oh, the invisible truth stay sober
I can't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
But I'm cryin' at the bar
I'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me
And looked at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

[Chorus]
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
Wonderin' whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky

And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained

[Chorus]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude]
Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely
Chloe Mitchell

[Chorus]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

[Bridge]
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

[Outro]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called, it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up, but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, whole thing, whole thing, whole thing

[""The Best Birthday""]
Oh my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another motherfuckin' level
Now, a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this

(Yeezy taught me)
I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before
I was in there like, ""Oh shit, I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of Pussy Town before""
It's like you got this shit reupholstered or some shit
What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all reupholstered?
(Yeezy reupholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga, I'ma thank him
I'ma buy the album, I'ma download that motherfucker
I'ma shoot a bootlegger
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Ah
I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted
With the bezel? This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source
I 'member, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source
That's right, that's right
Yo, yo, babe, yo, yo, this the best birthday ever
Where'd you learn to treat a nigga like this?

32,I’m In It,"[Verse 1]
Damn, your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds

I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders

She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

34,So Appalled,"[Refrain]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 1]
I'm so appalled, Spalding, ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean, goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Chorus]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
I mean this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Five-star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous

[Verse 2]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil', so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fuckin' insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fuckin' not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fuckin' ridiculous

[Chorus]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
I mean this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Five-star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous

[Verse 3]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil' in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watchin' it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove', leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin', I own you all, yuugh

[Refrain]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 4]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment, ""Thou shalt not hate, kid""
My movement is like the Civil Rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Chorus]
Ayy, yo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous

One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care

And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now, thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit!

I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke

36,All Falls Down,"[Chorus]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

[Verse 1]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well

[Chorus]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe

[Chorus]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down

[Verse 3]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, ‘cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
‘Cause every road that leads to Heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

[Chorus]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world ‘cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see

[Chorus]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Verse]
Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights

40,I Thought About Killing You,"[Intro]
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

[Spoken Word]
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

[Verse]
I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we Old Bay
We was all born to die, nigga, DOA
Niggas say they hero, mm, I don't see no cape
Mm, I don't see no, mm, yeah, I don't see no, mm, mm
If I wasn't shinin' so hard, wouldn't be no shade
Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (Ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay",Kanye West,Rap

You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'
'Cause you was in college complainin' 'bout it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga dick the whole time

How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me

You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

45,Through the Wire,"[Music Video - Intro]
Last October Grammy nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
It's your boy, Kanye to the…
Chi-Town, what's goin' on?
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Over Chorus]
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin
I said, ""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?""
""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!""

[Verse 1]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""

Do you think about me now and then?

Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through

Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day

You want me workin' on my messagin'
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson
But soundin' like George Jefferson
Then they questionin' my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again
Then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two, but me and you, that's infinity

[Refrain]
And I know you wouldn't...

[Chorus]
I don't feel like she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up (Why?)
Butterfly in my wrist

And I don't feel like (Uhh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (Love me or hate me)

[Outro]
For any guy that ever fucked up (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (Love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (Gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (Ohh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testin' her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
""For better or for worse"", huh?
For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you

And I know you wouldn't leave",Kanye West,Rap

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments
You more like ""love to start shit""

In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?

Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds

Politicians hide themselves away

And on and on and on and on and on

They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you gotta ride it well

Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams

And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!

You've got to bleed for the dancer!

Bathed in cool breeze, silver starlight
Breaks dawn from night

But soon, the world had its evil way
My heart was blinded, love went astray

And I can still hear her last goodbyes

Turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay

Burning globe of obscene fire

13,God Is Dead?,"[Verse 1]
Lost in the darkness, I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

[Chorus 1]
The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

[Verse 2]
Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

[Chorus 2]
When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

[Verse 3]
To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing’s right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

[Chorus 3]
I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don’t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead

[Bridge]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 4]
But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red
I don’t believe that God is dead

First, it was the bomb
Vietnam napalm
Disillusioning
You push the needle in
From life, you escape
Reality's black drape
Colours in your mind
Satisfy your time

[Bridge 1]
Oh, you, you know you must be blind
To do such things like this
To take the sweet that you don't know
You're giving Death a kiss
Poor little fool now
Your mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you, it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill
Don't stop to think now

You're having a good time, baby, but that won't last
Your mind's all full of things, you're living too fast
Go out, enjoy yourself, don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you, stick the needle in, yeah

Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer seeing
Life's reality
Push the needle in
Face Death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin
Caused by deadly pin

Build my dreams on flakes of snow

The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone

The thoughts and images, the unborn child that never was conceived

[Verse 2]
When little worlds collide, I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell
And flashing memories are cast into the never-ending well
The name that scorns the face, the child that never sees the cause of man
The deathly darkness that belies the fate of those who never ran

[Verse 3]
You gotta believe, yeah, I'm talking to you
Well, I know it's hard for you to know the reason why
And I know you'll understand more when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on

[Verse 4]
I want you to listen, I'm trying to get through
Love has given life to you and now it's your concern
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return
Still, I look, but not to touch the seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls, the secret stays unknown

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Just remember love is life and hate is living death
Treat your life for what it's worth and live for every breath
Looking back I've lived and learned, but now, I'm wondering
Here, I wait and only guess what this next life will bring, haha!

22,After Forever,"[Verse 1]
Have you ever thought about your soul
Can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think
That when you are dead
You just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head
Or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name
That you read in the book
When you were in school?

[Verse 2]
When you think about death
Do you lose your breath
Or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope
On the end of a rope?
Do you think he's a fool?
Well I have seen the truth
Yes, I've seen the light
And I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared
When you're lonely and scared
At the end of our days

[Bridge]
Could it be you're afraid
Of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realise before they criticise
That God is the only way to love
Is your mind so small
That you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say that you may as well
Worship the sun?

[Verse 3]
I think it was true it was people like you
That crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had
Was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure
When your day is near
Say you don't believe?
You had the chance
But you turned it down
Now you can't retrieve

[Outro]
Perhaps you'll think before you say
That God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realise
That He is the one
The only one who can save you now
From all this sin and hate
Or will you jeer at all you hear?
Yes, I think it's too late",Black Sabbath,Metal

You're searching for your mind, don't know where to start
Can't find the key to fit the lock on your heart
You think you know, but you are never quite sure
Your soul is ill, but you will not find a cure, yeah!

Your world was made for you by someone above
But you choose evil ways instead of love
You made me master of the world where you exist

25,Supernaut,"[Verse 1]
I want to reach out and touch the sky
I want to touch the sun, but I don't need to fly
I'm gonna climb up every mountain of the moon
And find the dish that ran away with the spoon

I've crossed the oceans, turned every bend
I found the plastic and the golden rainbow's end
I've been through magic and through life's reality
I've lived a thousand years, it never bothered me

In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky

We sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undone

And it just had to be
Oh, they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea

Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore

The world today is such a wicked place
Fighting going on between the human race
People go to work just to earn their bread
While people just across the sea are counting their dead

A politician's job they say is very high
For he has to choose who's gotta go and die
They can put a man on the Moon quite easy
While people here on Earth are dying of old diseases

I’ve opened the door, now my mind has been released

Well, I don’t want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No, I don’t want no one to tell me where I’m gonna go when I die
I want to live my life, I don’t want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself ’cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one long overdose
People try to rule the nation
I just see through their frustration
People hiding their real face
Keep on running their rat race
Behind each flower grows a weed
In their world of make-believe

So believe what I tell you, it’s the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself you know you really shouldn’t have to pretend
Don’t let those empty people try to interfere with your mind

Obsessed with fantasy, possessed with my schemes

Well, I feel something’s taking me I don’t know where
It’s like a trip inside a separate mind
The ghost of tomorrow from my favourite dream
Is telling me to leave it all behind
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Gotta get to happiness, want no more of sorrow

Realised when to hide
How I tried to get away from you, now
Now am I right if I fight
That I might just get away from you, now
Sting me!

Well, I feel something’s giving me the chance to return
It’s giving me the chance of saving my soul
Pictures of demigod are fading away
I’m going backward, but I’m in control

Was it wise to disguise
How I tried to get away from you, now?
Is there a way that I can pay
Or is it true I have to stay with you, now?

How I lied, went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right in my fight

Now I’ve found my happiness, providence of sorrow

Soon the days were passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams

Take you right back around

46,Cornucopia,"[Verse 1]
Too much near the truth they say
Keep it till another day
Let them have their little game
Delusion helps to keep them sane
Let them have their little toys
Matchbox cars and mortgaged joys
Exciting in their plastic ways
Frozen food in a concrete maze

[Chorus]
You’re gonna go insane
I’m trying to save your brain

[Verse 2]
All right!
I don’t know what’s happening
My head’s all torn inside
People say I’m heavy
They don’t know what I hide
Take a life, it’s going cheap
Kill someone, no one will weep
Freedom’s yours, just pay your dues
We just want your soul to use

[Chorus]
You’re gonna go insane
I’m trying to save your brain",Black Sabbath,Metal
47,The Thrill of It All,"[Verse 1]
Inclination of direction
Walk and turn and twist adrift
With the children of creation
Futuristic dreams we sift
Clutching violently we whisper
With a liquefying cry
Any deadly final answers
That are surely doomed to die

[Verse 2]
Won’t you help me, Mister Jesus
Won’t you tell me if you can
When you see this world we live in
Do you still believe in Man
If my song’s become my freedom
And my freedom turns to gold
Then I’ll ask the final question
If the answer could be sold

[Bridge]
Well, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it
’Cause I got no reason to lie, yeah
Forget your problems that don’t even exist
And I’ll show you a way to get high
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!

So come alive, you know you’re magic to me
Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah
Time to stop all your messing around
Don’t you think I know my own mind
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!

Why can’t you believe, it's right here to be seen
Do you always have to be told, yeah
For you and your problem, you can never give up
Long before the answer was sold

Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah

48,Loner,"[Verse 1]
He's just a loner, he never says ""Hello""
A friend to no one, he's got no place to go
He don't look happy, he looks through furtive eyes
He ain't got nothing, no one to sympathize
Alright now
He hides himself away, his secrets not revealed
As life just passes by, he keeps himself concealed
A solitary man, an enigmatic child
A riddle never solved, a prisoner exiled
Alright now

[Chorus]
I wonder if the loner can assimilate
A lifeless lived alone plays devil's advocate
Come on now

[Bridge]
Has he ever tried to be happy? Reached out from inside
Someone on who he can depend
It's getting too late to recover, he won't stand a chance
And into his own hell, he'll descend
Don't descend
Don't descend
Don't descend
Don't descend

[Verse 2]
No understanding of things we already know
He has to live his life and just learn how to let go
Alright, yeah

[Chorus]
Communication's an impossibility
His own best friend, but he's his own worst enemy
The secrets of his past locked deep inside his head
I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead
Come on, yeah

49,Junior’s Eyes,"[Verse 1]
Junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears
He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would hear
Junior sighed as his hands reached out to the sky
Junior cried the day that his best friend died
Yeah!

[Chorus]
You're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Junior's eyes, they couldn't disguise the pain
His father was leaving and Junior's grieving again
Innocent eyes watched the man who gave everything
Junior's sorrow, he knew what tomorrow would bring

[Chorus]
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Junior's eyes looked into the skies once more
Now he knew well, this life was hell for sure
He desperately tried, his fingertips stretched to the stars, yeah
Reaching for reason, along with the time and the scars
Yeah!

You're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry

0,The Spirit Carries On,"[Nicholas]
Where did we come from?
Why are we here?
Where do we go when we die?
What lies beyond
And what lay before?
Is anything certain in life?

They say ""Life is too short""
""The here and the now""
And ""You`re only given one shot""
But could there be more
Have I lived before
Or could this be all that we`ve got?

[Chorus]
If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

I used to be frightened of dying
I used to think death was the end
But that was before
I`m not scared anymore
I know that my soul will transcend

I may never find all the answers
I may never understand why
I may never prove
What I know to be true
But I know that I still have to try

[Chorus]
If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on

[Victoria]
""Move on, be brave
Don`t weep at my grave
Because I`m no longer here
But please never let
Your memory of me disappear""

[Nicholas]
Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My questioning mind
Has helped me to find
The meaning in my life again
Victoria`s real
I finally feel
At peace with the girl in my dreams
And now that I`m here
It`s perfectly clear
I found out what all of this means

[Chorus]
If I die tomorrow
I`d be alright
Because I believe
That after we`re gone
The spirit carries on",Dream Theater,Metal
1,Octavarium,"[I. Someone Like Him]
[Lyrics]

[Instrumental Intro]

I never wanted to become someone like him, so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that this was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd never be someone like him

So many years have passed since I proclaimed
My independence, my mission
My aim and my vision, so secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know that I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm missing out this time

As far as I could tell, there's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself, could this be everything?
Then all I swore, that I would never be was now
So suddenly, the only thing, I wanted to become
To be someone just like him

[II. Medicate (Awakening)]
[Lyrics]

A doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep

For 30 years, where have I been?
Eyes open, but not getting through to me

Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear as my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast, can't you stop what's happening?

A higher dosage he prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot, a brief awakening

I feel the relapse, can't break free
Eyes open, but not getting through to me

Medicate me, infiltrate me
Side effects appear, as my conscience slips away
Medicate me, science failing
Conscience fading fast, can't you stop what's happening?

Flying off the handle be careful with

[Lyrics]

Root, our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path
Second, asking questions, search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you
Third, try to break through, long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath
Fourth, loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire
Fifth, tortured Insanity, a smothering hell
Try to escape but no avail
Sixth, the calls of admirers who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more
Seventh, innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs
Octave, step after step, we try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late

Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!
Trapped inside this Octavarium!

Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge

Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by and I roll with them
Arrows fly
Seas increase and then fall again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
This world is spinning around me
This world is spinning without me and
Every day sends future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last

[Verse 2]
Watch the sparrow falling
Gives new meaning to it all
If not today nor yet tomorrow
Then some other day
I'll take seven lives for one
And then my only father's son
As sure as I did ever love him
I am not afraid

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This world is spinning around me
The whole world keeps spinning around me
All life is future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last

Pull me under, pull me under
Pull me under, I'm not afraid
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is to set it right

Dust fills my eyes

[Miracle:]
Friday evening
The blood still on my hands
To think that she would leave me now
For that ungrateful man

Sole survivor
No witness to the crime
I must act fast to cover up
I think that there`s still time

He'd seem hopeless and lost with this note
They'll buy into the words that I wrote]
Feeling good this Friday afternoon
I ran into Julian
Said we'd get together soon

He's always had my heart
He needs to know
I'll break free of the Miracle
It's time for him to go

This feeling inside me!
Finally found my love, I've finally broke free
No longer torn in two!
He'd kill his brother if he only knew

Their love renewed
They'd rendezvous
In a pathway out of view
They thought no one knew
Then came a shot out of the night

We'll lay down today
One last time
Until we fade away

And the ending draws near
Spirits rise through the air
All their fears disappear
It all becomes clear

A blinding light comes into view
An old soul exchanged for a new
Familiar voice comes shining through

This feeling inside me!
Finally found my life, I'm finally free
No longer torn in two!
I learned about my life by living through you

Finally found my life, I'm finally free
No longer torn in two!
Living my own life by learning from you

We'll meet again my friend!

4,Panic Attack,"[Verse 1]
All wound up, on the edge, terrified
Sleep disturbed, restless mind, petrified
Bouts of fear permeate all I see
Heightening nervousness threatens me

[Bridge 1]
I am paralyzed
So afraid to die

[Verse 2]
Caught off guard, warning signs never show
Tension strikes, choking me, worries grow

[Chorus]
Why do I feel so numb?
Is it something to do with where I come from?
Should this be fight or flight?
I don't know why I'm constantly so uptight

[Verse 3]
Rapid heartbeat pounding through my chest
Agitated body in distress
I feel like I'm in danger
Daily life is strangled by my stress
A stifling surge shooting through all my veins
Extreme apprehension, suddenly I'm insane
Lost all hope for redemption
A grave situation desperate at best

Why do I feel so numb?
Is it something to do with where I come from?
Should this be fight or flight?

5,A Change of Seasons,"[I. The Crimson Sunrise]
[Instrumental]

[II. Innocence]

I remember a time
My frail, virgin mind
Watched the crimson sunrise
Imagined what it might find
Life was filled with wonder
I felt the warm wind blow
I must explore the boundaries
Transcend the depth of winter's snow

Innocence caressing me
I never felt so young before
There was so much life in me
Still I longed to search for more

But those days are gone now
Changed like a leaf on a tree
Blown away forever
Into the cool autumn breeze
The snow has now fallen
And my sun's not so bright
I struggle to hold on
With the last of my might

In my den of inequity
Viciousness and subtlety
Struggle to ease the pain
Struggle to find the same

Ignorance surrounding me
I've never been so filled with fear
All my life's been drained from me
The end is drawing near...

[III. Carpe Diem]

""Carpe diem
Seize the day""

I'll always remember
The chill of November
The news of the fall, the sounds in the hall
The clock on the wall ticking away
""Seize the Day,"" I heard him say
""Life will not always be this way
Look around, hear the sounds
Cherish your life while you're still around""

(""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
(Old Time is still a-flying;)
(And this same flower that smiles today)
(Tomorrow will be dying"")

We can learn from the past
But those days are gone
We can hope for the future
But there may not be one

The words stuck in my mind
Alive from what I've learned
I have to seize the day
To home I returned

Preparing for her flight
I held with all my might
Fearing my deepest fright
She walked into the night
She turned for one last look
She looked me in the eye
I said, ""I Love You... Good-bye""

(""It's the most awful thing you'll ever hear;)
(Your mom... who you dearly love...)
(Has had to leave... all our lives"")
(""Seize the day!"")
(""Something happened"")
(""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may"")
(""She was killed"")

[IV. The Darkest Of Winters]

[V. Another World]

So far or so it seems
All is lost with nothing fulfilled
Off the pages and the T.V. screen
Another world where nothing's true

Tripping through the life fantastic
Lose a step and never get up
Left alone with a cold blank stare
I feel like giving up

I was blinded by a paradise
Utopia high in the sky
A dream that only drowned me
Deep in sorrow, wondering why

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Then string him up for all the world to see

I'm sick of all you hypocrites holding me at bay
And I don't need your sympathy to get me through the day
Seasons change and so can I
Hold on Boy, no time to cry
Untie these strings, I'm climbing down
I won't let them push me away!

Oh come let us adore him
Abuse and then ignore him
No matter what, don't let him be
Let's feed upon his misery
Now it's time for them
To deal with me

[VI. The Inevitable Summer]

[VII. The Crimson Sunset]

I'm much wiser now
A lifetime of memories run through my head
They taught me how
For better or worse
Alive or dead
I realize there's no turning back
Life goes on the offbeaten track

I sit down with my son
Set to see the Crimson Sunset
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
Many years have come and gone
I've lived my life, but now must move on
(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)
He's my only one
Now that my time has come
Now that my life is done
We look into the sun
""Seize the day and don't you cry
Now it's time to say good-bye
Even though I'll be gone
I will live on
Live on""",Dream Theater,Metal
6,Metropolis - Part I: The Miracle and the Sleeper,"[Part 1]
The smile of dawn arrived early May
She carried a gift from her home
The night shed a tear to tell her of fear
And of sorrow and pain she'll never outgrow

[Bridge]
Death is the first dance, eternal

[Part 2]
There's no more freedom
The both of you will be confined
To this mind

[Part 3]
I was told there's a miracle for each day that I try
I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died
I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid
I was told if you dream of the next world
You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire

[Part 4]
As a child, I thought I could live without pain, without sorrow
As a man, I've found it's all caught up with me
I'm asleep, yet I'm so afraid

[Part 5]
Somewhere like a scene from a memory
There's a picture worth a thousand words
Eluding stares the faces before me
It hides away and will never be heard of again

Deceit is the second without end

Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive

Before we lock the doors

When the struggle between our children has ended
Now the Miracle and the Sleeper know
That the third is love

Shine-lake of fire!
Lines take me higher!
My mind drips desire
Confined and overtired

Living this charade
Is getting me nowhere
I can’t shake this charade
The city’s cold blood calls me home

Home! it’s what I long for
Back home where I belong!

The city, it calls to me
Decadent scenes from my memory
Sorrow, eternity
My demons are coming to drown me

Help! I’m falling, I’m crawling
I can’t keep away from its clutch
Can’t have it, this habit
It’s calling me back to my home

[Miracle:]
I remember the first time she came to me
She poured her soul out all night and cried

I remember I was told there’s a new love that’s born
For each one that has died

I never thought that I
Could carry on with this life
But I can’t resist myself
No matter how hard I try!

Living their other life
Is getting them nowhere
I’ll make her my wife!
Her sweet temptation calls me home

Home! It’s what I long for
My home, where she belongs!

Her ecstasy means so much to me
Even deceiving my own blood
Victoria watches and thoughtfully smiles
She’s taking me to my home

Help! he’s my brother, but I love her
I can’t keep away from her touch
Deception, dishonor
It’s calling me back to my home

Her story, it holds the key
Unlocking dreams from my memory
Solving this mystery
Is everything that is a part of me

[Verse 1]
In a dark and lonely corner
Of a time-worn dockside inn
Sits the local barstool warrior
Talking to his gin
Tracing past decisions
He motions for a shot
Is he doomed to be a man this world forgot?
Just a prisoner of the monster on his back

[Chorus]
Call it bad luck, call it fate
Call it stuck here the rest of my days
Serves me right
What went wrong?
And where do I belong?

[Verse 2]
In the glow of flashing lights
On the shoulder of the road
Clutching at the bruises on her skin
She tries to signal danger
With anguish in her eyes
Will he see the world of pain she's in?
Or is it too late?

[Chorus]
Was it bad luck? Was it fate?
Or a past that she couldn't escape?
It's not right, something's wrong
Just where do I belong?

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
Promises made, crying in vain, all empty
Never accepting the blame
And not letting go of the shame
A river of tears as months turn to years, all wasted
On someone not willing to change
Now only a shadow remains
No one can save you
And there's no one to save
It has been written
You will become all you think
All you feel, all you dream

And I won't look back

Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself won't set you free

Misgiving and dismay, nightmares of wasted days
Can't live your life this way, something needs to change
Cold feet and second thoughts; entangled, tied in knots
Avoidance at all costs, a painful thing to watch

Fear can live inside you
Push you to the edge
Face the fear within you
Wake up from the dead

Falling into darkness

Unconscious relaxation
What a pleasant nightmare
And I can't wait to get there again

Every time I close my eyes
There's another vivid surprise
Another whole life waiting
Chapters unfinished, fading

[Past]
Closer now - Slowly coming into view
I've arrived - Blinding sunshine beaming through

[Verse 2]
There's a house I'm drawn to
Familiar settings, nothing new
There's a pathway leading there
With a haunting chill in the air

There's room at the top of the stairs
Every night I'm drawn up there
There's a girl in the mirror
Her face is getting clearer
Young child won't you tell me why I'm here?

[Pre-Chorus]
In her eyes - I sense a story never told
Behind the disguise - There's something tearing
At her soul

Tonight I've been searching for it
A feeling that's deep inside me
Tonight I've been searching for
The one that nobody knows
Trying to break free

I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Tears my heart into two
I'm not the one the sleeper thought he knew

[Bridge]

[Present]
Back on my feet again
Eyes open to real world
Metropolis surrounds me
The mirror's shattered the girl

Why is this other life
Haunting me everyday
I'd break through the other side
If only I'd find the way

Something's awfully familiar
The feeling's so hard to shake
Could I have lived in that other world
It's a link that I'm destined to make

I'm still searching but I don't know what for
The missing key to unlock my mind's door

[Chorus]
Today I am searching for it
A feeling that won't go away
Today I am searching for
The one that I only know
Trying to break free

I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head
Tears my soul into two
I'm not the one I thought I always knew

I just can't help myself
I'm feeling like I'm going out of my head

But I don't mind - I hope to find the truth",Dream Theater,Metal

Look another way
You won't find it here
So die another day

The coldness of his words
The message in his silence
""Face the candle to the wind...""
This distance in my voice
Isn't leaving you a choice
So if you're looking for a time to run away...

[Chorus 2]
You won't find it here
Look another way
You won't find it here
So try another day

[Bridge]
They took pictures of our dreams
Ran to hide behind the stairs
And said, ""Maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall""
But if they don't come down
Resist the need to pull them in and throw them away
Better to save the mystery
Than surrender to the secret

I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Come alive

[Verse 2]
You feel I'm asking too much of you but can't let go
Fear breeds the hate and your apathy, empty and hollow
You lost your faith, there's no getting through
Why shut me out?
Frantic, disturbed, filled with misery, can't figure it out

[Interlude]
Sleepless, worse for wear, staring at the ceiling
Numb, sedated, intoxicated

[Pre-Chorus]
Deafening, deafening
Shut it out, shut it out
Burning, burning
No way out, no way out

Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
I know that it's tearing you apart
Don't leave me now, don't leave me now
Come alive

[Bridge]
Asked me to listen
Can't go on and face another day
I lied, not admitting
What I lost is still in you
Something's missing
You see darkness in my eyes
Maculate, there is no cure
Playing over, stop pretending
Warped inside its never ending tide

Don't leave me now

13,Space-Dye Vest,"[Verse 1]
Falling through pages of Martens on angels
Feeling my heart pull west
I saw the future dressed as a stranger
Love in a space-dye vest
Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding
A pool in the shape of a heart
Beauty projection in the reflection
Always the worst way to start

""But he's the sort who can't know anyone intimately, least of all a woman. He doesn't know what a woman is. He wants you for a possession, something to look at like a painting or an ivory box. Something to own and to display. He doesn't want you to be real, or to think, or to live. He doesn't love you, but I love you. I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and feelings, even when I hold you in my arms. It's our last chance... It's our last chance...""

[Verse 2]
Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it
Learning to swallow the rage
Found a new girl I think we can make it
As long as she stays on the page
This is not how I want it to end
And I'll never be open again

""...I get up with the sun... Listen. You have your own room to sleep in. I don't care what you do. I don't care when. That door gets locked. That door gets locked at night by nine o'clock. If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd better find some place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in this house. Supper is ready...""

[Bridge]
There's no one to take my blame
If they wanted to
There's nothing to keep me sane
And it's all the same to you
There's nowhere to set my aim
So I'm everywhere
Never come near me again
Do you really think I need you?
I'll never be open again
I could never be open again
I'll never be open again
I could never be open again

And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend
And I'll never be open again

14,Fatal Tragedy,"[Intro]
Alone at night, I feel so strange
I need to find all the answers to my dreams
When I sleep at night, I hear the cries
What does this mean?

[Verse 1]
I shut the door and traveled to another home
I met an older man, he seemed to be alone
I felt that I could trust him, he talked to me that night]
Without love, without truth
There can be no turning back
Without faith, without hope
There can be no peace of mind

[Verse 2]
As the night went on, I started to find my way
I learned about a tragedy, a mystery still today
I tried to get more answers, but he said, ""You're on your own""
Then he turned away and left me as I stood there all alone
He said, ""You'll know the truth as your future days unfold""

[Chorus]
Without love, without truth
There can be no turning back
Without faith, without hope
There can be no peace of mind

Written on the water, memories dissipate
Eyes begin to open, darkness drifts away
Time and space, like roses whose petals drop and fade

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see

There is nothing sacred, only heaven knows
So turn towards the sun and look into your soul

Too much hope will never be enough

Still running uphill, swimming against the current

18,The Count of Tuscany,"[Verse 1]
Several years ago
In a foreign town
Far away from home
I met the Count of Tuscany

A young, eccentric man
Bred from royal blood
Took me for a ride
Across the open countryside

Get into my car
Let's go for a drive
Along the way, I'll be your guide
Just step inside

Maybe you recall
A cannibal curator
A character inspired by
My brother's life

Winding through the hills
The city far behind
On and on we drove
Down narrow streets and dusty roads

At last we came upon
A picturesque estate
On sprawling emerald fields
An ancient world of times gone by

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me introduce
My brother
A bearded gentleman
Historian

Sucking on his pipe
Distinguished accent
Making me uptight
No accident

[Chorus]
I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive
I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

[Verse 2]
Would you like to see
Our secret holy place?
I come here late at night
To pray to him by candlelight

Then peering through the glass
I saw with disbelief
Still dressed in royal clothes
The saint behind the altar

History recalls
During times of war
Legend has been traced
Back inside these castle walls

Where soldiers came to hide
In barrels filled with wine
Never to escape
These tombs of oak are where they died

[Pre-Chorus]
Down the cellar stairs
I disappear
Like the English heir
The end is near

Come and have a taste
A rare vintage
All the finest wines
Improve with age

[Chorus]
I want to stay alive
Everything about this place
Just doesn't feel right
I
I don't want to die
Suddenly I'm frightened for my life

I want to say goodbye
This could be the last time
You see me alive
I
I may not survive
Knew it from the moment we arrived

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Could this be the end?
Is this the way I die?
Sitting here alone
No one by my side

I don't understand
I don't feel that I deserve this
What did I do wrong?
I just don't understand

Give me one more chance
Let me please explain
It's all been circumstance
I'll tell you once again

You took me for a ride
Promising a vast adventure
Next thing that I know
I'm frightened for my life

""Now wait a minute, man!
That's not how it is!
You must be confused
That isn't who I am

Please don't be afraid
I would never try to hurt you
This is how we live
Strange although it seems

Please try to forgive!

The chapel and the saint
The soldiers and the wine
The fables and the tales
All handed down through time

Of course you're free to go
Go and tell the world my story
Tell about my brother, tell them about me...

19,Through Her Eyes,"[Nicholas:]
She never really had a chance
On that fateful moonlit night
Sacrificed without a fight
A victim of her circumstance

Now that I`ve become aware
And I`ve exposed this tragedy
A sadness grows inside of me
It all seems so unfair

I`m learning all about my life
By looking through her eyes

Just beyond the churchyard gates
Where the grass is overgrown
I saw the writing on her stone
I felt like I would suffocate

In loving memory of our child
So innocent, eyes open wide
I felt so empty as I cried
Like part of me had died

I`m learning all about my life
By looking through her eyes

And as her image
Wandered through my head
I wept just like a baby
As I lay awake in bed

And I know what it`s like
To lose someone you love
And this felt just the same

She wasn`t given any choice
Desperation stole her voice
I`ve been given so much more in life
I`ve got a son, I`ve got a wife

I had to suffer one last time
To grieve for her and say goodbye
Relieve the anguish of my past
To find out who I was at last

The door has opened wide
I`m turning with the tide
Looking through her eyes",Dream Theater,Metal

Come bleed the beast

Leading to your salvation
Slaying the weak
Ethnic elimination

Any day we'll all be
Swept away
You'll be saved
As long as you obey

Tools of the devil inside
Written in holy disguise
Meant to deceive and divide

Un-consenting plural wives

21,Take the Time,"[Intro]
Just let me catch my breath...
I've heard the promises
I've seen the mistakes
I've had my fair share of tough
Breaks
I need a new voice, a new law
A new way
Take the time, reevaluate
It's time to pick up the pieces
Go back to square one
I think it's time for a change

[Verse 1]
There is something that I feel
To be something that is real
I feel the heat within my mind
And craft new changes with my eyes
Giving freely wandering promises
A place with decisions I'll fashion
I won't waste another breath

[Chorus 1]
You can feel the waves coming on
(It's time to take the time)
Let them destroy you or carry you on
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of the world
But no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind

[Verse 2]
The unbroken spirit
Obscured and disquiet
Finds clearness this trial demands
And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief
For the fortune lies still in his hands

[Verse 3]
If there's a pensive fear, a wasted year
A man must learn to cope
If his obsession's real
Suppression that he feels must turn to hope

[Chorus 2]
Life is no more assuring than love
(It's time to take the time)
There are no answers from voices above
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of the world
And no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind

[Chorus 3]
Close my eyes
And feel the water rise around me
Drown the bead of time
Let my senses fall away
I can see much clearer now, I'm blind
""Ora che ho perso la vista, ci vedo di più""

[Chorus 1]
You can feel the waves coming on
(It's time to take the time)
Let them destroy you or carry you on
(It's time to take the time)
You're fighting the weight of the world
But no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind
Ooh yeah

You're choking down your words again
Feel the nerves set in
Unspoken frustration
They see right through you
Paper thin, like the ghost within

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed

[Verse 2]
The stare of a stranger
Is like a wound that bleeds again
Silent as the dead
The victim, the martyr
Like Daniel in the lion's den
Time and time again

[Chorus]
A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed, I am paralyzed

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Relentless mental drain
What do you stand to gain?
Viewing life through such a narrow, fractured lens
Will ensure you end up on the losing end
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed, I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed, I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed",Dream Theater,Metal

[II. About to Crash]
[Lyrics]

[Verse]
She can't stop pacing
She never felt so alive
Her thoughts are racing
Set on overdrive
It takes a village
This she knows is true
They're expecting her
And she's got work to do
He helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes
He says ""I've never seen her get this bad
Even though she seems so high""
He knows that she can't fly
And when she falls out of the sky
He'll be standing by
She was raised in a small midwestern town
By a charming and eccentric loving father
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
And everyone thought highly of her
And she tried everyday
With endless drive
To make the grade
Then one day
She woke up to find
The perfect girl
Had lost her mind
Once barely taking a break
Now she sleeps the days away
She helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
All she wants to do is cry
No one ever knew she was so sad
Cause even though she gets so high
And thinks that she can fly
She will fall out of the sky
But in the face of misery
She found hopefulness
Feeling better
She had weathered
This depression
Much to her advantage
She resumed her frantic pace
Boundless power
Midnight hour
She enjoyed the race

Hearing voices from miles away
Saying things never said
Seeing shadows in the light of the day
Waging a war inside my head

Years and years of
Bloodshed and warfare
Our mission was only to get in and kill
A free vacation
Of palmtrees and shrapnel
Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell

Feeling strangers staring my way
Reading minds never read
Tasting danger with each word I say
Waging a war inside my...

[IV. The Test That Stumped Them All]

Standing in the darkness
Waiting for the light
The smell of pure adrenaline
Burning in the night
Random blinding flashes
Aiming at the stage
Intro tape begins to roll
Igniting sonic rage
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all
""The boy is simply crazy
Suffering from delusions
We honestly think that maybe
He might need an institution
He lives in a world of fiction
And really could use some help
We have just the place to fix him
To save him from himself""
Curled up in the darkness
Searching for the light
The smell of stale sweat and shit
Streaming through the night
Random urine testing
Pills red, pink and blue
Counseling and therapy
Providing not a clue
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all
""We can't seem to find the answers
He seemed such a clear cut case
We cannot just let him leave here
And put all this work to waste
Why don't we try shock treatment
It really might do some help
We have just the tools to fix him
To save him from himself""

Goodnight kiss in your nightgown
Lavender in your bed
So innocent as you lie down
Sweet dreams that run through your head
Are you lonely without mommy's love?
I want you to know I'd die for that moment
You're just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all
It's been 5 years to the day and
My tainted blood's still the same
I can't help acting this way and
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay
I'm so lonely without baby's love
I want you to know I'd die for one more moment
I'm just a poor girl
Afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all

[VI. Solitary Shell]
[Lyrics]

[Verse]
He seemed no different from the rest
Just a healthy normal boy
His mama always did her best
And he was daddy's pride and joy
He learned to walk and talk on time
But never cared much to be held
And steadily he would decline
Into his solitary shell
As a boy he was considered somewhat odd
Kept to himself most of the time
He would daydream in and out of his own world
But in every other way he was fine
He's a monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell
A temporary catatonic
Madman on occasion
When will he break out
Of his solitary shell
He struggled to get through his day
He was helplessly behind
He poured himself onto the page
Writing for hours at a time
As a man he was a danger to himself
Fearful and sad most of the time
He was drifting in and out of sanity
But in every other way he was fine
He's a monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell
A momentary maniac
With casual delusions
When will he be let out
Of his solitary shell

[VII. About to Crash (reprise)]

I'm alive again
The darkness far behind me
I'm invincible
Despair will never find me
I feel strong
I've got a new sense of elation
Boundless energy
Euphoria fixation
Still it's hard to just get by
It seems so meaningless to try
When all i want to do is cry
Who would ever know i felt so sad
Even though i get so high
I know that i will never fly
And when i fall out of the sky
Who'll be standing by
Will you be standing by

[VIII. Losing Time/Grand Finale]
[Lyrics]

[Verse]
She dresses in black everyday
She keeps her hair simple and plain
She never wears makeup
But no one would care if she did anyway
She doesn't recall yesterday
Faces seem twisted and strange
But she always wakes up
Only to find she'd been miles away
Absence of awareness
Losing time
A lapse of perception
Losing time
Wanting to escape
She had created a way to survive
She learned to detach from herself
A behavior that kept her alive

Hope in the face of our human distress
Helps us to understand the turbulence deep inside
That takes hold of our lives
Shame and disgrace over mental unrest
Keeps us from saving those we love
The grace within our hearts
And the sorrow in our souls
Deception of fame
Vengeance of war
Lives torn apart
Losing oneself
Spiraling down
Feeling the walls closing in
A journey to find
The answers inside
Our elusive mind",Dream Theater,Metal

Spineless cowards and fearless warriors
Hopeful children, mothers and fathers
Our blood-filled rivers fueled by hate
We worship heroes, kings and saints
But who's out there to save us from ourselves?

All you will ever know, all life that ever was
All you despise or love, living out their lives

And all that you're expecting me to give

It's all about you not me
It's all about you not me

You're building my prison brick by brick
Eating your words is making me sick
You get what you want
Cause nothing is sacred
You're reading my mind
And leaving me naked
You say I gotta give before I receive it
One of these days I'll believe it

Close your eyes and begin to relax
Take a deep breath and let it out slowly
Concentrate on your breathing
With each breath you become more relaxed
Imagine a brilliant white light above you
Focus in on this light as it flows through your body
Allow yourself to drift off as you fall
Deeper and deeper into a more relaxed state of mind
Now, as I count back from ten to one
You will feel more peaceful and calm
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
You will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you
Five, four, three, two
If at any time you need to come back
All you need to do is open your eyes

Safe in the light that surrounds me
Free of the fear and the pain
My subconscious mind starts spinning through time
To rejoin the past once again

Nothing seems real, I'm starting to feel
Lost in the haze of a dream
And as I draw near, the scene becomes clear
Like watching my life on a screen

Hello, Victoria!
So glad to see you, my friend",Dream Theater,Metal
28,Repentance,"VIII]

[Intro]
Hello Mirror!
So glad to see you, my friend
It's been a while

[Verse 1]
Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage running through my head
Patterns of my life I thought adorned me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament

Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

[Pre-Chorus]
I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't

[Chorus]
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

[Verse 2]
Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends

Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this unswept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

[Pre-Chorus]
I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done than haven't

[Chorus]
Sometimes you've got to be wrong
And learn the hard way
And just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

IX]
""Until that moment
I'd never felt like I'd failed at anything
I felt like I failed her
And I failed myself, and I failed my children
It's still really hard to deal with.""

""I want to thank you for helping me
To see my own selfishness
And to tell you how regretful I am it has hurt you.""

""I'm sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital, Grandpa
When you were on your deathbed
I'm sorry I didn't come to your funeral...
I don't know if I was selfish or I just was too scared to face it
It's one of the biggest regrets of my life.""

""I'm here to confess with you that what I did was wrong
And I'm asking for your forgiveness...""

""The only unforgivable thing hauls itself out of bed
Looks over my shoulder at the bloody English weather.""

""I really regret not being able to see my friend Andy.""

""One of my best friends, who's the godfather of my daughter
He asked me to sing or play something at his wedding
And I turned it down because I was busy and
I guess, too much of a chickenshit to do it
And I feel sorry for that, because it was a very, very close friend of mine.""

""So, I wanted to apologize to anyone
That I've upset or offended by my words
It's just an opinion, but unfortunately
I tend to express it as a fact
And that's kind of arrogant. Isn't it?""

""I think it's the betrayal
It still haunts me.""

""I'm sorry for what I did back then
I was a different person
I really was and I'm so sorry
I wish it wouldn't have happened, but it did
And I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?""

""I guess I'm simply sorry for being me and not you
I so often wish you could be here with me to show me the way.""

[Spoken Outro]
“If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it

We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone
We will see how our experience can benefit others
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear

We will lose interest in selfish things
And gain interest in our fellows
Self-seeking will slip away
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change

Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us
What we could not do for ourselves

Are these extravagant promises? We think not
They have been fulfilled amongst others:
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly
We will always be true to our principles.”

""You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free.""

""The truth is the truth
And so all you can do is live with it.""",Dream Theater,Metal

Someone, someone is trying
To tell him something, will he listen? (Should he listen?)
Someone, someone is dying
To find out something, will he reason? (What is the reason?)

Do you see it there on the door?
Death is coming, life nevermore
Obsession drives me, clouding my mind
What's the message, am I running out of time?

In search of something, death by numbers (Getting closer)
Someone, someone is dying
To know the answer, the key to heaven (137)

30,Through My Words,"[Nicholas:]
All your eyes have ever seen
All you've ever heard
Is etched upon my memory
Spoken through my words

All that I take with me
Is all you've left behind
We're sharing one eternity
Living in two minds
Linked by an endless thread
Impossible to break",Dream Theater,Metal
31,Wither,"[Verse 1]
Let it out, let it out
Feel the empty space
So insecure
Find the words and let it out

[Verse 2]
Staring down, staring down
Nothing comes to mind
Find the place
Turn the water into wine

[Pre-Chorus]
But I feel I'm getting nowhere
And I'll never see the end

[Chorus]
So I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I breakdown
And let the story guide me

[Verse 3]
Turn it on, turn it on
Let the feelings flow
Close your eyes
See the ones you used to know

[Verse 4]
Open up, open up
Don't struggle to relate
Lure it out
Help the memory escape

[Pre-Chorus]
Still this barrenness consumes me
And I feel like giving up

[Chorus]
So I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear
I breakdown
And let the story guide me
I wither
And give myself away

[Bridge 1]
Like reflections on the page
The world's what you create

[Verse 5]
I drown in hesitation
My words come crashing down
And all my best creations
Burning to the ground

[Verse 6]
The thought of starting over
Leaves me paralyzed
Tear it out again
Another one that got away

[Bridge 2]
I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear

[Chorus]
I wither
And render myself helpless
I give in
And everything is clear

32,Surrounded,"[Intro]
Morning comes too early
And nighttime falls too late
And sometimes all I want to do is wait
The shadow I've been hiding in
Has fled from me today

[Verse 1]
I know it's easier to walk away
Than look it in the eye
But I will raise a shelter to the sky
And here beneath this star tonight I'll lie
She will slowly yield the light
As I awaken from the longest night

[Verse 2]
Dreams are shaking
Set sirens waking up tired eyes
With the light the memories
All rush into his head
By a candle stands a mirror
Of his heart and soul she dances
She was dancing through the night above his bed

[Chorus]
And walking to the window
He throws the shutters out against the wall
And from an ivory tower hears her call
""Let light surround you""

[Bridge]
It's been a long, long time
He's had a while to think it over
In the end he only sees the change
Light to dark
Dark to light
Light to dark
Dark to light

[Verse 3]
Heaven must be more than this
When angels waken with a kiss
Sacred hearts won't take the pain
But mine will never be the same

[Chorus]
He stands before the window
His shadow slowly fading from the wall
And from an ivory tower hears her call
""Let the light surround you""

[Verse 4]
Once lost but I was found
When I heard the stained glass shatter all around me
I sent the spirits tumbling down the hill
But I will hold this one on high above me still
She whispers words to clear my mind
I once could see but now at last I'm blind

[Outro]
I know it's easier to walk away
Than look it in the eye
But I had given all that I could take
And now I've only habits left to break
Tonight I'll still be lying here
Surrounded in all the light",Dream Theater,Metal
33,The Root of All Evil,"[VI. Ready]

Proud enough for you to call me arrogant
Greedy enough to be labeled a thief
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief

Never could have just a part of it
I always need more to get by
Getting right down to the heart of it
The root of all evil has been running my whole life

Dirty enough for me to lust
Leaving nothing left to trust
Jealous enough to still feel envious
Lazy enough to sleep all day
And let my life just waste away
Selfish enough to make you wait for me

Driven blindly by our sins
Misled so easily
Entirely ready to leave it behind
I'm begging to break free

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast them all away
And help to give me strength to face another day

I am ready
Help me be what I can be

[VII. Remove]

Self-centered fear has got a hold of me
Clutching my throat
Self righteous anger running all through me
Ready to explode

Procrastination paralyzing me
Wanting me dead
These obsessions that keep haunting me
Won't leave my head

Help to do for me what I can't do myself
Take this fear and pain
I can't break out of this prison all alone
Help me break these chains

Humility now my only hope
Won't you take all of me
Heal this dying soul

I can feel my body breaking
I can feel my body breaking
I'm ready to let it all go

I can feel my body shaking
Right down to the foundation
The root of it all

Take all of me
The desires that keep burning deep inside
Cast them all away
And help to give me strength to face another day

I am ready
Help me be what I can be

I am ready
Come to me
Take me away

34,Honor Thy Father,"[Verse 1]
We're taught unconditional love
That blood is thicker than water
That a parent's world would revolve
Always around their son or their daughter
You pretended I was your own
And even believed that you loved me
But were always threatened by some
Invisible blood line that only you could see

You took advantage of an outreached hand
And twisted it to meet your every need
''Gimme time to re-charge my batteries
I'll see her when she's older and I'll bounce her on my knee''
Well listen to me you ungrateful fool
Here comes a dose of reality!
You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man
The door is now closed on your pathetic little plan

[Pre-Chorus 1]
On and on and on and on it goes
It's so easy to run away with nothing in tow

[Chorus 1]
How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the nerve to blame this mess on me?
Never in my life have I seen someone
So ignorant to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I tried your 4 bill therapy
I tried to make amends
But nothing could lure you out of your selfish shell again

Expecting everyone to bow and kiss your feet
Don't you see respect is not a one way street?
Blaming everyone for all that you've done wrong
I'll get my peace of mind when you hear this song

[Pre-Chorus 2]
On and on and on and on it goes
And with every passing day true colors show

[Chorus 2]
How can you ever sleep a wink at night
Pretending that everything is alright
And have the balls to blame this mess on me?
Never in my life have I seen someone
Oblivious to the damage he has done
You're the rotted root in the family tree
Yeah

[Bridge]
Watch where you walk
Don't you dare cross the crooked step
Watch the way you talk
Don't cross the crooked step!

35,The Best of Times,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Remember days of yesterday
How it flew so fast
The two score and a year we had
I thought it would always last
Those summer days and west coast dreams
I wished would never end
A young boy and his father
Idol and best friend

[Chorus 1]
I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
A lifetime together
I'll never forget

[Verse 2]
The morning shows on the radio
The case of the missing dog
Lying on the pillows at the old 812
Watching Harold and Maude
The record shops, the stickball fields
My home away from home
And when we weren't together
The hours on the phone

[Chorus 1]
I'll always remember
Those were the best of times
I'll cherish them forever
The best of times

[Bridge]
But then came the call
Our lives changed forever more
""You can pray for a change
But prepare for the end...""

The fleeting winds of time
Flying through each day
All the things I should've done
But time just slipped away

These were the best of times
I'll miss these days
Your spirit lit my life each day

Thank you for the inspiration
Thank you for the smiles
All the unconditional love
That carried me for miles
It carried me for miles
But most of all thank you for my life

These were the best of times
I'll miss these days
Your spirit lit my life each day

But I'll be okay
Your spirit guides my life each day

36,Out of Reach,"[Verse 1]
There's something about this girl
Some kind of magic
I swear she cast a spell on me
Not the first time
Might be the last
Can't let this moment slip away
Try to find the words
None sit right with me
Air of confidence
But I can barely breathe

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's without a care
Electrified and held there
A thousand volts igniting me
Her waves crash over me
Far below, out of reach
The undertow, my reverie

[Bridge]
Sadness in her smile
Love, it's been a while
Near but far away
She chases it each day
A promise to come back
All the while still waiting
Seems it lost its way

[Chorus]
Out of reach
Just too hard to reach
You're letting your life slip away
Out of reach
Yeah, it's hard to reach
There's another day
Although you're hurting and afraid
You're stronger than yesterday

37,A Nightmare to Remember,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
A nightmare to remember
I'd never be the same
What began as laughter
So soon would turn to pain

The sky was clear and frigid
The air was thick and still
Now I'm not one to soon forget
And I bet I never will

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2A]
Picture for a moment
The perfect irony
A flawless new beginning
Eclipsed by tragedy

The uninvited stranger
Started dancing on his own
So we said goodbye to the glowing bride
And we made our way back home

[Verse 2B]
Life was so simple then
We were so innocent
Father and mother
Holding each other

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Without warning
Out of nowhere
Like a bullet
From the night

Crushing glass
Rubber and steel
Scorching fire
Glowing lights

Screams of terror
Pain and fear
Sounds of sirens
Smoke in my eyes

Sudden stillness
Blackened silence
No more screaming
No more cries

[Chorus 1]
Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed

Stunned and bewildered
Cold and afraid
Torn up and broken
Frightened and dazed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Lying on the table in this unfamiliar place
I'm greeted by a stranger]
Hopelessly drifting
Bathing in beautiful agony
I am endlessly falling
Lost in this wonderful misery

In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
And all of the panic inside starts to fade
Hopelessly drifting
Bathing in beautiful agony

[Verse 5]
""Tell me does this hurt you?""
Said the faceless man
""Can you move all of your fingers?
Can you try your best to stand?""

I asked about the others, ""Is everyone okay?""
He told me not to worry as he turned and looked away

[Chorus 2]
Hopelessly drifting
Bathing in beautiful agony
I am endlessly falling
Lost in this wonderful misery

In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake
And all of the panic inside starts to fade
Hopelessly drifting
Bathing in beautiful agony

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Day after day and night after night
Replaying the events, did they ever see the red light?
Over and over, scene by scene
Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams

How can you prepare for what would happen next?
No son should ever have to see his father such a mess
It's a miracle he lived, it's a blessing no one died
By the Grace of God above, everyone survived

Life was so simple then
We were so innocent
It will stay with us forever
A nightmare to remember!

38,The Glass Prison,"[I. Reflection]

[Verse]
Cunning, baffling, powerful
(Been beaten to a pulp)
Vigorous, irresistible
(Sick and tired and laid low)
Dominating, invincible
(Black-out, loss of control)
Overwhelming, unquenchable
(I'm powerless, have to let go)

I can't escape it
It leaves me frail and worn
Can no longer take it
Senses tattered and torn

Hopeless surrender
Obsession's got me beat
Losing the will to live
Admitting complete defeat

Fatal descent
Spinning around
I've gone too far
To turn back round

Desperate attempt
Stop the progression
At any length
Lift this obsession

Crawling to my glass prison, a place where no one knows
My secret lonely world begins
So much safer here, a place where I can go
To forget about my daily sins

Life here in my glass prison, a place I once called home
Fall in nocturnal bliss again
Chasing a long lost friend I no longer can control
Just waiting for this hopelessness to end

[II. Restoration]

[Verse 1]
Run - fast from the wreckage of the past
A shattered glass prison wall behind me
Fight - past walking through the ashes
A distant oasis before me

Cry - desperate crawling on my knees
Begging god to please stop the insanity
Help me - I'm trying to believe
Stop wallowing in my self pity

""We've been waiting for you my friend
The writing's been on the wall
All it takes is a little faith
You know you're the same as us all""

[Chorus]
Help me - I can't break out this prison all alone
Save me - I'm drowning and I'm hopeless on my own
Heal me - I can't restore my sanity alone

[Verse 2]
Enter the door
Desperate
Fighting no more
Help me restore
To my sanity
At this temple of hope

I need to learn
Teach me how
Sorrow to burn
Help me return
To humanity
I'll be fearless and thorough
To enter this temple of hope

Believe
Transcend the pain
Living the life
Humility
Opened my eyes
This new odyssey
Of rigorous honesty

Serenity
I never knew
Soundness of mind
Helped me to find
Courage to change
All the things that I can

""We'll help you perform this miracle
But you must set your past free
You dug the hole, but you can't bury your soul
Open your mind and you'll see""

[Chorus]

[III. Revelation]

[Verse]
Way off in the distance I saw a door
I tried to open
I tried forcing with all of my will but still
The door wouldn't open

Unable to trust in my faith
I turned and walked away
I looked around, felt a chill in the air
Took my will and turned it over

The glass prison which once held me is gone
A long lost fortress
Armed only with liberty
And the key of my willingness

Fell down on my knees and prayed
""Thy will be done""
I turned around, saw a light shining through
The door was wide open!",Dream Theater,Metal
39,This Dying Soul,"[IV. Reflections of Reality (Revisited)]

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hello, mirror - so glad to see you my friend, it's been a while
Searching, fearless, where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial?

Face yourself, man!
Brace yourself and trace your hell back

You've been blinded, living like a one-way cold existence all the while!
Now it's time to stare the problem right between the eyes, you long lost child!

[Chorus 1]
I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking, and shaking
And left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making
A change to fix this dying soul, this dying soul
This dying soul!

[Fast Rap Verse 1]
Born into this world a broken home
Surrounded by love yet all alone
Forced into a life that's split in two
A mother and a father both pulling you

Then you had to deal with loss and death
Everybody thinking they know best
Coping with this shit at such an age
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage

Family disease pumped through your blood
Never had the chance you thought you could
Running all the while with no escape
Turning all that pain into blame and hate

Living on your own by twenty-one
Not a single care and having fun
Consuming all the life in front of you
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue

[Verse 2]
Possessive obsessions, selfish childish games
Vengeful resentments, passing all the blame

[Fast Rap Verse 2]
Living out a life of decadence
Acting without thought of consequence
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast
While spitting on the ones that matter most

Running power mad with no control
Fighting for the credit they once stole
No one can ever tell you what to do
Ruling other's lives while they can't stand the thought of you!

[Verse 3]
A living reflection seen from miles away
A hopeless affliction having run astray

[Chorus 1]
I wanna feel your body breaking
Wanna feel your body breaking, and shaking
And left in the cold
I want to heal your conscience making
A change to fix this dying soul, this dying soul
This dying soul!

[Bridge]
Now that you can see all you have done
It's time to take that step into the kingdom
All your sins will only make you strong
And help you break right through the prison wall

[V. Release]

[Verse]
Come to me my friend (listen to me)
I'll help this torture end (help to set me free)
Let your ego go (I can't carry this load)
You can't go through this alone (I feel so hopeless and exposed)

You'll find your peace of mind (give me some direction)
You can no longer hide (break out of this isolation)
Let humility (openness, honesty)
And become what you can be (a healing tranquility)

Help me
Save me
Heal me
I can't break out of this prison all alone

These tormenting ghosts of yesterday
Will vanish when exposed
You can't hold onto your secrets
They'll only send you back alone

Your fearless admissions
Will help expel your destructive obsessions
With my help i know you can
Be at one with god and man

Hear me
Believe me
Take me
I'm ready to break through this prison wall

Welcome tired pilgrim into the circle
We have been waiting
Everyone's gathered for your arrival
All the believers

Angels fall all for you, heretic
Demon heart, bleed for us!

I've been waiting for you
Weary preacher man
You have been expected
Now we can begin

Let this hallowed
Day of Judgment reign

I have known you father
And your sacred quest
Blessed soldier fighting
You shall never rest

I have known you
But do you know me?

I will fight for you!

Dark Master of sin, now my soul is yours
Dark Master, my guide, I will die for you
Dark Master inside!

[Verse 2]
I cannot see his face
But I could feel his spite
A presence from the dead
Abandoned by the light

This shadow will
Consume him from within

This power that I sense
The rage behind those eyes
Is just a shrouded ghost
A spirit sealed inside

The body and the soul both threats
For they are one!

Demon heart, bleed for us!

My soul is yours, Dark Master!

[Bridge]
Don't bother, trying to find them
They will be coming to you
Fight, fight and destroy until you can't take anymore!

Slay, spill the blood of the rebels
They are the children of Hell
Flesh of the undead, stopping at nothing to kill

Sin, caught in a moment of weakness
Committed the greatest of all
Sold half of my soul and now it's too late for you

I judge as my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us

Unwelcome ones
Your time has come!

Lord, you are my god and my shepherd
Nothing more shall I want
Walk through the abyss
Into the shadow of death

Fear, there is no evil to fear now
For I know you are with me
My cup overflows
With my enemy's blood

I decay in the house of the Lord
Forever amen
Death will follow me
All the days of my life

I judge as my eyes see
I judge and I am just
For I speak of the beast
That lives in all of us

Unwelcome ones
Your time has come!

Servants of the fallen fight to pave the way
For their savior's calling on this wicked day
Through a veil of madness, with a vicious blade
One man rises up, standing in their way

It's time for your reckoning!

My soul grows weaker
He knows and he waits
He watches over me
Standing at the infernal gates

In the hour of darkness
The moment I feared has passed
The moment I lost my faith
Promising salvation

My soul is my own now!
I do not fight for you, Dark Master!",Dream Theater,Metal

It doesn`t make any sense
This tragic ending

There`s something still missing

Heard some of the rumours told

Did Victoria wound his soul?
Did she bid him farewell?

It holds the many clues

I`m finally shown what I have always known

Coincidence I can`t believe

Are these her memories
Awakened through my eyes

45,Endless Sacrifice,"[Verse 1]
Cold
Lying in my bed
Staring into darkness
Lost
I hear footsteps overhead
And my thoughts return again

[Hook]
Like a child who's run away
And won't be coming back
Time keeps passing by
As night turns into day

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so far away
And so alone
I need to see your face
To keep me sane
To make me whole

[Chorus]
Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind!
Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie!
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice!

[Verse 2]
Pain
It saddens me to know
The helplessness you feel
Your light
Shines on my soul
While a thousand candles burn

[Hook]
Outside this barren room
The rain is pouring down
The emptiness inside
Is growing deeper still

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so far away
And so alone
You long for love's embrace
To keep you sane
To make you whole

[Chorus]
Try to stay alive
Until I hear your voice
I'm gonna lose my mind!
Someone tell me why
I chose this life
This superficial lie!
Constant compromise
Endless sacrifice!

[Chorus 2]
Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice!
Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice!

[Instrumental section]

[Bridge]
Over the distance
We try to make sense
Of surviving together
While living apart
Striving for balance
We rise to the challenge
Of staying connected
In spite of circumstance

All you've forsaken
And all that you've done
So that I could live out
This undying dream
Won't be forgotten
Or taken for granted
I'll always remember
Your endless sacrifice

Moments wasted
Isolated
Time escaping
Endless sacrifice!
Moments wasted

46,Wait for Sleep,"[Verse 1]
Standing by the window
Eyes upon the moon
Hoping that the memory
Will leave her spirit soon

[Chorus 1]
She shuts the doors and lights and lays her body on the bed
Where images and words are running deep
She has too much pride to pull the sheets above her head
So quietly she lays and waits for sleep

[Verse 2]
She stares at the ceiling and tries not to think
And pictures the chains she's been trying to link again
But the feeling is gone

[Chorus 2]
And water can't cover her memory
And ashes can't answer her pain
""God give me the power to take breath from a breeze
And call life from a cold metal frame""

[Outro]
In with the ashes
Or up with the smoke from the fire
With wings up in heaven
Or here, lying in bed
Palm of her hand to my head
Now and forever curled
In my heart and the heart of the world",Dream Theater,Metal
47,Hollow Years,"[Verse 1]
He's just the kind of man
You hear about
Who leaves his family for
An easy out
They never saw the signs
He never said a word
He couldn't take another day

[Pre Chorus]
Carry me to the shoreline
Bury me in the sand
Walk me across the water
And maybe you'll understand

[Chorus]
Once the stone
You're crawling under
Is lifted off your shoulders
Once the cloud that's raining
Over your head disappears
The noise that you'll hear
Is the crashing down of hollow years

[Verse 2]
She's not the kind of girl
You hear about
She'll never want another
She'll never be without
She'll give you all the signs
She'll tell you everything
Then turn around and walk away

[Pre Chorus]
Carry me to the shoreline
Bury me in the sand
Walk me across the water
And maybe you'll understand

48,Under a Glass Moon,"[Intro]
Tell me, remind me
Chase the water racing from the sky
Always beside me
Taste the memories running from my eyes
Nervous flashlights scan my dreams
Liquid shadows silence their screams
I smile at the moon
Chasing water from the sky
I argue with the clouds
Stealing beauty from my eyes

[Chorus]
Outside the soundness of your mind
Bathing your soul in silver tears
Beneath a blackened summer sky
Praying for time to disappear

[Verse]
Beneath a summer sky
Under glass moonlight
Night awaits the lamb's arrival
Liquid shadows crawl
Silver teardrops fall
The bride subsides to her survival

By your hand
I've awakened
Bear this honor in my name

Outside the soundness of your mind
Bathing your soul in silver tears
Beneath a blackened summer sky
Praying for time to disappear

Outside the soundness of your mind

49,The Ministry of Lost Souls,"[Verse 1]
The water's edge is where she waits
Lost soul still wandering
Meant to die but she's stuck
Not crossing over

The other side is where he waits
His spirit reaching out
Meant to save but she's too scared
To take his hand

[Pre-Chorus]
Living in a world without you (Drowning in the past)
Is living in no world at all
So now I call on you

[Chorus]
Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now

Don't turn your back on paradise!

[Verse 2]
Feeling scared, she's prepared
To give up everything
She can't stand
To feel like half of her is fading

He will choose the only way
To rid her of her pain
Take her soul now
The decision has been made

[Pre-Chorus]
Living in a world without love (A burden to my soul)
Is living in a worthless world
So I will call on you

[Chorus]
Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now

Remember me, you were so young
How could I tell you?
Remember me, I am the one
Who saved your life that night

[Bridge]
I was the one
Who would not abandon you
Even in death
I was the one who would not leave you

I used my freedom to protect you
And all the while direct you
Do you remember me this time?
Even in death, I gave you life

I gave you life!

[Instrumental Break]

I wanted to deserve a place
A place beside you
This time when I reached out my hand
It reached all the way to heaven

Remember me, I gave you life
You would not take it
Your suffering was all in vain
It's almost over now

Goodbye!
It's almost over now
Goodbye!

It's time
I release you from this life
Don't turn your back on paradise!

0,The Number of the Beast,"[Spoken intro]
Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty six

[Verse 1]
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair

YEAH!

[Verse 2]
The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell?

[Chorus 1]
666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

[Verse 3]
Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

[Chorus 2]
666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

[Guitar solo]
[Guitar solo]

[Verse 4]
This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes

[Chorus 3]
666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course",Iron Maiden,Metal
1,Fear of the Dark,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room you've sensed that something's watching you

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Verse 3]
Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace, you find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

[Instrumental Interlude]
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

[Verse 4]
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

[Chorus]
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

2,The Trooper,"[Verse 1]
You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

[Refrain]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh",Iron Maiden,Metal
3,Hallowed Be Thy Name,"[Intro]
I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low
Running low, yeah

[Verse 1]
When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream?

[Verse 2]
Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak

Tears fall but why am I crying?
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end?

[Verse 3]
As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell ""God be with you""
If there's a God why has He let me go?

As I walk my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

[Verse 4]
Mark my words believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes, he killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard, we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?

[Verse 1]
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack

Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives

Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men

Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

5,2 Minutes to Midnight,"[Verse 1]
Kill for gain, or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The golden goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?

[Chorus]
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb

[Verse 2]
The blind men shout ""Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers""
The napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast ... yeah!
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?

The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight

The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun

[Pre-Chorus]
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune, the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore?

6,Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"Hear the rime of the ancient mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea

And the music plays on, as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings

And the ship sails on, back to the north
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime

Sailing on and on and north across the sea
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse, a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung

And the curse goes on and on and on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me

""Day after day, day after day
We stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water everywhere and all the boards did shrink
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink""

""There,"" calls the mariner, ""There comes a ship o’er the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?""

See... onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See, she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two

Death and she life in death
They throw their dice for the crew
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now
Then... crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She... she, life in death
She lets him live, her chosen one

""One after one by the star dogged moon
Too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
And cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
They dropped down one by one.""

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the sea
Then down in falls comes the rain

[Guitar Solo]

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes

And revenge still is sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto him

And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins

The mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell this tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on and on and on",Iron Maiden,Metal

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
There's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late

Running, scrambling, flying

Running, scrambling, flying

Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again

Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our Spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns

Rolling, turning, diving

8,Wasted Years,"[Verse 1]
From the coast of gold
Across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on
Far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day

[Chorus]
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

[Verse 2]
Too much time on my hands
I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

[Chorus]
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

[Chorus]
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years

And realize you're living in the golden years",Iron Maiden,Metal
9,Dance of Death,"[Verse 1]
Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
About a thing that I saw
One night wandering in the Everglades
I'd one drink but no more
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move

[Verse 2]
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led

[Verse 3]
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me

[Bridge]
And I danced, and I pranced, and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes
Lifeless figures - they were undead - all of them
They had ascended from hell

[Verse 4]
As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me
Below my undead body
Just danced the circle of dead
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me

[Verse 5]
By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled
I ran like hell, faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6]
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Have a drink and say a prayer for it

[Bridge]
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead

[Outro]
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go
But I'll never go dancing no more

10,Empire of the Clouds,"[Movement 1]

[Instrumental intro]

[Intro]
To ride the storm to an empire of the clouds
To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
To ride the storm to a kingdom that will come
To ride the storm and damn the rest oblivion

[Verse 1]
Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
Grey lady giant of the skies
You hold them in your arms
The millionth chance they laughed
To take down his majesty’s craft
To India they say magic carpet float away
An October fateful day

[Movement 2]

[Verse 2]
Mist is in the trees
Stone sweats with the dew
The morning sunrise, red before the blue
Hanging at the mast, waiting for command
His Majesty’s airship, the R101

[Verse 3]
She’s the biggest vessel built by man
A giant of the skies
For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside
Drum roll tight her canvas skin, silvered in the sun
Never tested with the fury, with the beating yet to come
The fury yet to come

[Verse 4]
In the gathering gloom
The storm rising in the west
The coxswain stared
Into the plunging weather glass

[Verse 5]
We must go now
We must take our chance with fate
We must go now
For a politician, he can’t be late

[Verse 6]
The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch
But the ship is in their backbone
Every sinew, every inch
She never flew at full speed, a trial never done
Her fragile outer cover her Achilles would become
An Achilles yet to come

[Verse 7]
Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
Loyal to the king and an airship creed
The engines drum, the telegraph sounds
Release the cords that bind us to the ground

[Verse 8]
Said the coxswain
“Sir, she’s heavy, she’ll never make this flight“
Said the captain
“Damn the cargo, we’ll be on our way tonight“
Groundlings cheered in wonder
As she backed off from the mast
Baptizing them her water from the ballast fore and aft
Now she slips into our past

[Movement 3]

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 9]
Fighting the wind as it rolls you
Feeling the diesels that push you along
Watching the channel below you
Lower and lower into the night
Lights are passing below you
Northern France asleep in their beds
Storm is raging around you
A million to one, that’s what he said

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 10]
Reaper standing beside her
With his scythe cuts to the bone
Panic to make a decision
Experienced men asleep in their graves
Her cover is ripped and she’s drowning
Rain is flooding into the hull
Bleeding to death and she’s falling
Lifting gas is draining away

[Instrumental Break]

[Movement 4]

[Verse 11]
“We’re down lads“ came the cry
Bow plunging from the sky
Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
The flares to guide her path, ignited at the last
The empire of the clouds
Just ashes in our past, just ashes at the last

[Verse 12]
Here lie their dreams as I stand in the sun
On the ground where they built and the engines did run
To the moon and the stars
Now what have we done?
Oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on
Dreams live on, dreams live on

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east
The empire of the clouds may rest in peace
And in a country churchyard laid head to the mast
Eight and forty souls who came to die in France",Iron Maiden,Metal
11,Revelations,"[Intro]
O, God of earth and altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride

[Verse 1]
Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The secret of the hanged man, the smile on his lips

[Chorus]
The light of the blind, you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening, you'll see

[Verse 2]
She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the eye of the sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears that I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched and I waited for the dawn, oh

[Chorus]
The light of the blind, you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The eyes of the Nile are opening, you'll see
Go

[Guitar solo]
[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Bind all of us together
Ablaze with hope and free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
Still the wind and rain
For the one who will be king
The watcher in the ring
It is you, oh
It is you
It is you",Iron Maiden,Metal
12,Phantom of the Opera,"[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
You know, and I know that you ain't got long now to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past

[Verse 2]
You're standing in the wings
There you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now, I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call

[Bridge]
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I'm running and hiding in my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me
You torture me back at your lair

[Outro]
Torture me back at your lair",Iron Maiden,Metal
13,Powerslave,"[Verse 1]
Into the Abyss I'll fall, the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night, watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris, risen again

[Chorus]
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death

[Verse 2]
When I was living this lie, fear was my game
People would worship and fall
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For He is a man and a God
And He will die too

[Chorus]
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death

[Instrumental break/bridge]

[Verse 3]
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned
Marbled in stone
A shell of a man, god preserved -
For a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I'll strike from the grave

[Chorus]
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god
Why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death

[Outro]
Slave to the Power of Death...
Slave to the Power of Death...",Iron Maiden,Metal
14,Brave New World,"[Verse 1]
Dying swans, twisted wings
Beauty not needed here
Lost my love, lost my life
In this garden of fear
I have seen many things in a lifetime alone
Mother love is no more
Bring this savage back home

Wilderness, house of pain
Makes no sense of it all
Close this mind, dull this brain
Messiah before his fall
What you see is not real
Those who know will not tell
All is lost, sold your soul
To this brave new world

In a brave new world
In a brave new world
A brave new world
In a brave new world

Rip the bones from my flesh
Silent screams laughing here
Dying to tell you the truth
You are planned and you are damned
In this brave new world

Maybe one day I'll be an honest man
Up till now I'm doing the best I can

17,The Evil That Men Do,"[Verse 1]
Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her, If I could only see her now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Balancing on a ledge, oh
Living on a razor's edge

The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me
And I will pray for you, some day I may return
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn

Living on a razor's edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razor's edge

18,If Eternity Should Fail,"[Intro]
Here is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothed in white, stand in the light
Here is the soul of a man

Time to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a man

[Verse 1]
When the world was virgin before the coming of men
Just a solar witness, the beginning of the end
From a world of magma to a cold rock face
The ascent of madness and a human race

We are strange believers all of us
There are stranger truths immortal lust
We rise from slumber he calls our name
Recalls our number abide with pain

[Chorus]
Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

[Verse 2]
To god’s illusion which I recall
Was our delusion before the fall
The angels come and the angels go
But the lord of light shining below

Eternal blackness beyond the stars
We think our wisdom will get that far
At the master’s table, the table’s bare
No land of plenty, devastation, despair

[Chorus]
Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail
Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail

If eternity should fail

[Spoken Outro]
Good day, my name is Necropolis
I am formed of the dead
I am the harvester of the soul meat
And I suck the lives from around my bed
My own two sons I gave them breath
And I filled their living corpses with my bile
What humanity I knew I have long forgotten
For me eternity is nothing but a short while",Iron Maiden,Metal

We want information, information, information
Who are you?
The new number 2
Who is number 1?
You are number 6
I am not a number, I am a free man!
[Laughter]

I'm on the run, I kill to eat
I'm starving now, feelin' dead on my feet

20,The Red and the Black,"The morals of life and the perils of death
Take the wrong way out running out of breath
Meet my match in the afterlife
Suppress the demons that plague the night
A tortured mind is a safe place to go
But the truth lurks down in the dark below
Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find

See myself in the hall of mirrors
A different shape every step I take
A different mind every step of the line
But in the end they are all mine
Laughing sorrow inside your head
Can’t get out just a feeling of dread
I know this burden's a heavy load
A dark mistake never ending road

The black jack king and the red queen clash
The artful dodger he counts his stash
The joker’s wild like an impish child
While madame fortune she waits inside
The good luck charm is overkill
The tired old soldier says fire at will
Planes overhead go search destroy
The ones below human decoy

I need somebody to save me

Meanwhile we play the waiting game
The clock is struck the horse is lame
And when we think that this is done
Chance your luck a four leafed one
You hedge your bets the battle lost
To wait in vain and count the cost
The thin edged line
Between good and bad
And cast the luck be happy sad

I need somebody to save me

The red and the black
People don’t want the truth
Look in their eyes and you send them away
The red and the black
Fate and hypocrisy
Burden’s a heavy load there is no doubt
The red and the black
All out of luck again
How many chances can anyone have
The red and the black
Treachery out to win
There in the wrong place and at the wrong time

I need somebody to save me",Iron Maiden,Metal
21,Alexander the Great (356-323 BC),"[Spoken Intro]
""My son, ask for thyself another kingdom
For that which I leave is too small for thee""

[Verse 1]
Near to the east
In a part of ancient Greece
In an ancient land called Macedonia
Was born a son
To Philip of Macedon
The legend, his name was Alexander

[Verse 2]
At the age of nineteen
He became the Macedon King
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor
By the Aegean Sea
In 334 B.C
He utterly beat the armies of Persia

[Chorus]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a legend amongst mortal men

[Verse 3]
King Darius the third
Defeated fled Persia
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes
Then Egypt fell
To the Macedon King as well
And he founded the city called Alexandria

[Verse 4]
By the Tigris river
He met King Darius again
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela
Entering Babylon
And Susa, treasures he found
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia

[Chorus]
Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
Became a god amongst mortal men

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'
And legend said that who untied the knot
He would become the master of Asia

[Verse 6]
Hellenism he spread far and wide
The Macedonian learned mind
Their culture was a western way of life
He paved the way for Christianity
Marching on, marching on

[Verse 7]
The battle-weary marching side by side
Alexander's army line by line
They wouldn't follow him to India
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory

Alexander the Great
His name struck fear into hearts of men
Alexander the Great
He died of fever in Babylon",Iron Maiden,Metal
22,Flight of Icarus,"[Verse 1]

As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still

His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze

Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
""In the name of God, my father, I fly""

[Pre-Chorus]
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes, to ashes his grave

Fly on your way, like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way, like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun

23,22 Acacia Avenue,"[Verse 1]
If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know
So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice

[Verse 2]
If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it free
So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know

[Pre-Chorus]
Charlotte can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men don't know the risk of getting disease
Some day when you're reach the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show, any more

[Chorus]
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Charlotte isn't it time you stopped this mad life
Don't you ever think about the bad times
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?
Sometimes when your strolling down the avenue
The way you walk it makes men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

[Chorus]
22, the Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight

[Bridge]
Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want?

[Outro]
You're running away, don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte you've taken your life and you've thrown it away
You believe that because what you're earning?
Your life's good don't you know that it's hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside
All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags, you're coming with me",Iron Maiden,Metal
24,Where Eagles Dare,"[Verse 1]
It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
Of engines roar in the night
The mission is near, the confident men
Are waiting to drop from the sky

[Chorus 1]
The blizzard goes on, but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare

[Verse 2]
Bavarian Alps that lay all around
They seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
Are lying deep in the snow

[Chorus 2]
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
They're closing in, the fortress is near
It's standing high in the sky
The cable cars the only way in
It's really impossible to climb

[Chorus 3]
They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day

[Verse 4]
The panicking cries, the roaring of guns
Are echoing all round the valley
The mission complete, they make to escape
Away from the eagles nest

[Chorus 4]
They dared to go, where no one would try
They chose to fly where eagles dare",Iron Maiden,Metal

Black holes in his golden stare
God knows he wants to go home

Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned

If he had lived he would've crucified us all
Now he's standing on his last step
He thought; ""Oblivion? Well, it beckons us all""

Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned
Children of the Damned

Now it's burning his hands, he's turning to laugh
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face, screaming in pain
Peeling the skin from his eyes
Watch him die according to plan
He's dust on the ground, what did we learn?

You're children of the Damned
Like candles watch them burn
Burning in the light
You'll burn again tonight

26,The Clansman,"[Verse 1]
Wake alone in the hills
With the wind in your face
It feels good to be proud
And be free and a race
That is part of a clan
And to live on highlands
And the air that you breathe
So pure and so clean

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When alone on the hills
With the wind in your hair
With a longing to feel
Just to be free

In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans

Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong

They would all be ashamed
That the land of the free
Has been written in chains

And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what I want
I am the clansman

Be taken alive
And I know that we'll stand
And we'll fight for our land
And I swear that my bairns
Will be born free

[Verse 2]
Is it right to believe
In the need to be free
It's a time when you die
And without asking why
Can't you see what they do
They are grinding us down
They are taking our land
That belongs to the clans

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Not alone with a dream
Just a want to be free
With a need to belong
I am a clansman...

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And I know what I want
When the timing is right
Then I'll take what is mine
I am the clansman

And I know what I want
When the timing is right

27,Blood Brothers,"[Verse 1]
And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

[Verse 2]
Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement he beckons to me
And in a moment the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

[Chorus]
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

[Verse 3]
And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned?
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burnt

[Chorus]
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

[Verse 4]
There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad
Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

[Chorus]
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

[Verse 5]
When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy
When we're living our lives on the edge
Say a prayer on the book of the dead

[Chorus]
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers
We're blood brothers, we're blood brothers

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life...",Iron Maiden,Metal
28,The Book of Souls,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Sacrifices buried with kings
Accompany them on a journey with no end
To an afterlife that’s rich with fruit of all the gods
And to face the demons
Of their underworld haunts

[Verse 2]
The sentient is sent to seek out all the truth
A flight to earth that is a given from his birth
To rise from ashes of the dead
Out of the fire is sent to fulfill man’s desire

[Pre-Chorus]
By power day and night and death he ruled them
The sky and earth and the fires too
Two headed reptile, symbol of his reign
Universes of the underworld
A life that’s full of all the wealth and riches
Can never last for an eternity
After living in a golden paradise, the ultimate sacrifice

[Chorus]
Prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon
Falling of ages, forest of kings
The search for the truth, the book of souls

[Verse 3]
The rulers of planets and stars
The power of the kings of traders and the wars
Planetary cycles and the phases of the moon
Is in the document a kingdom they will learn

[Pre-Chorus]
They were praying to the gods of nature
And were living in the cities of stone
Towers reaching upward to the heavens
Sacred wonders for the world unknown
Make their lives be a mystery no more
Records kept and the passing of laws
Sacred gods to the book of lies
When a civilization dies

[Chorus]
Prophecy of sky gods, the sun and moon
Passing of old ways will come true soon
Falling of ages, forest of kings
The lost book of souls, destruction begins

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Ascending the throne wearing feathers and shells
He brought back their lives from the void
Alien invasion brings nothing but death
Mass exodus and plant life destroyed

[Verse 5]
Domain of the Earth to the journey of truth
The underworld caves, Mayan slaves
Defeat of the dark Lords, the ultimate proof
In the place where the ancestors rule

[Verse 1]
Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

[Pre-Chorus]
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

[Chorus]
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

[Verse 2]
The ferryman wants his money, you ain't gonna give it back
He can push his own boat as you set off up the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

[Pre-Chorus]
You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands to make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again

Your time will come
Your time will come
Your time will come

30,Sign of the Cross,"[Intro]

Eleven saintly shrouded men
Silhouettes stand against the sky
One in front with a cross held high
Come to wash my sins away

[Verse 1]
Standing alone in the wind and rain
Feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
Brought by the storm that is brewing

[Verse 2]
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming

[Verse 3]
Why then is God still protecting me
Even when I don't deserve it?
Though I am blessed with an inner strength
Some, they would call it a penance

[Verse 4]
Why am I meant to face this alone?
Asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise

[Verse 5]
They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgement day
And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away

[Chorus]
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

[Verse 6]
They'll be coming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding communion so the world be blessed
My creator, my God, lay my soul to rest

[Chorus]
The sign of the cross
The name of the rose
A fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

Lost the love of heaven above
Chose the lust of the earth below

31,Moonchild,"[Intro]
Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
And your trip begins
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires...

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
I am he, the bornless one
The fallen angel watching you
Babylon, the scarlet whore
I'll infiltrate your gratitude
Don't you dare to save your son
Kill him now and save the young ones
Be the mother of a birth strangled babe
Be the devil's own, Lucifer's my name

[Chorus]
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal

[Verse 2]
I count the heads of those unborn
The accursed ones, I'll find them all
And if you die by your own hand
As a suicide you shall be damned
And if you try to save your soul
I will torment you, you shall not grow old
With every second and passing breath
You'll be so alone, your soul will bleed to death

[Chorus]
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight

The twins they are exhausted, seven is this night
Gemini is rising as the red lips kiss to bite
Seven angels, seven demons battle for his soul
When Gabriel lies sleeping, this child was born to die

[Verse 3]
One more dies, and one more lives
One baby cries, one mother grieves
For all the sins you will commit
You'll beg forgiveness and none I'll give
A web of fear shall be your coat
To clothe you in the night
A lucky escape for you, young man
But I see you damned in endless night

[Chorus]
Moonchild, hear the mandrake scream
Moonchild, open the seventh seal
Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child
Moonchild, take my hand tonight",Iron Maiden,Metal
32,Tears of a Clown,"[Verse 1]
All alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemed
But never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despise

The false smile maketh of the man
Glass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown
All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truth
There’s something that inside has died

[Chorus]
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

[Verse 2]
Who motivates the motivator?
Facade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for cameras all okay
But tomorrow is another day he must get through

He had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun, where did it go?
We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we’ll never know

[Chorus]
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

[Chorus]
Tomorrow comes tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he’s feeling down
Tears of a clown
Maybe it’s all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down
Tears of a clown, tears of a clown
Tears of a clown, tears of a clown",Iron Maiden,Metal
33,For the Greater Good of God,"[Verse 1]
Are you a man of peace, or a man of holy war?
Too many sides to you, don't know which anymore
So many full of life, but also filled with pain
Don't know just how many will live to breathe again

A life that's made to breathe destruction or defense
A mind that's vain, corruption, bad or good intent
A wolf in sheep's clothing, or saintly or sinner
Or some that would believe a holy war winner

They fire off many shots and many parting blows
Their actions beyond the reasoning only God would know
And as He lies in Heaven, or it could be in Hell
I feel he's somewhere here, or looking from below
But I don't know, I don't know

[Refrain]
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

[Verse 2]
More pain and misery in the history of mankind
Sometimes it seems more like the blind leading the blind
It brings upon us more of famine, death and war
You know, religion has a lot to answer for

[Refrain]
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

[Verse 3]
And as they search to find the bodies in the sand
They find it's ashes that are scattered across the land
And as the spirits seem to whistle on the wind
A shot is fired somewhere, another war begins

And all because of it, you'd think that we would learn
But still the body count, the city fires burn
Somewhere, there's someone dying in a foreign land
Meanwhile, the world is crying, ""stupidity of man""
Tell me why, tell me why

[Refrain]
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

[Chorus]
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God

Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is
Please tell me now what life is
Please tell me now what love is
Well, tell me now what war is
Again, tell me what life is

[Chorus]
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God
For the greater good of God

He gave his life for us, he fell upon the cross
To die for all of those who never mourn his loss
It wasn't meant for us to feel the pain again

Tell me why",Iron Maiden,Metal
34,Infinite Dreams,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Infinite dreams, I can't deny them
Infinity is hard to comprehend
I couldn't hear those screams
Even in my wildest dreams
Suffocation waking in a sweat
Scared to fall asleep again
In case the dream begins again

[Verse 2]
Someone chasing, I cannot move
Standing rigid, a nightmare's statue
What a dream, when will it end and will I transcend?
Restless sleep, the mind's in turmoil
One nightmare ends, another fertile
It's getting to me so scared to sleep
But scared to wake now, in too deep

[Verse 3]
Even though it's reached new heights
I'd rather like the restless nights
It makes me wonder, makes me think
There's more to this, I'm on the brink
It's not the fear of what's beyond
It's just that I might not respond
I have an interest, almost craving
But would I like to get too far in?

[Verse 4]
Can't be all coincidence
Too many things are evident
You tell me you're an unbeliever
Spiritualist?
Well me, I'm neither
Wouldn't you like to know the truth
Of what's out there to have the proof?
And find out just which side you're on
Where would you end?
In Heaven or in Hell?

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Help me
Help me to find my true self without seeing the future
Save me
Save me from torturing myself even within my dreams

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
There's got to be just more to it than this
Or tell me why do we exist
I'd like to think that when I die
I'd get a chance, another time
And to return and live again
Reincarnate, play the game
Again and again and again and again",Iron Maiden,Metal
35,Killers,"[Intro]
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Oh yeah!
Ow! Yeah!
Ooh, look out!

[Verse 1]
You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs

[Verse 2]
My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me

[Bridge]
I can see what a life's meant to be
And you'll never know how I came to forsee, see, see

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike

[Verse 4]
The death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Oh yeah, I've done it again!
Yeah!

[Verse 5]
You walk through the subway, my eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs
Oh look out, I'm coming for you!
Ahahahaha!

Oh! Oh!",Iron Maiden,Metal
36,Afraid to Shoot Strangers,"[Verse 1]
Lying awake at night, I wipe the sweat from my brow
But it's not the fear, 'cause I'd rather go now
Trying to visualize the horrors that will lay ahead
The desert sand mound a burial ground

[Verse 2]
When it comes to the time are we partners in crime?
When it comes to the time, we'll be ready to die

[Verse 3]
God, let us go now and finish what's to be done
Thy Kingdom come, thy shall be done on Earth
Trying to justify to ourselves the reasons to go
Should we live and let live? Forget or forgive?

[Verse 4]
But how can we let them go on this way?
The reign of terror corruption must end
And we know deep down there's no other way
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say

Afraid to shoot strangers

37,Seventh Son of a Seventh Son,"[Verse 1]
Here they stand, brothers them all
All the sons, divided they'd fall
Here await the birth of the son
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one

[Verse 2]
Here the birth from an unbroken line
Born the healer, the seventh, his time
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds
Slowly unveiling the power he holds

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Then they watch the progress he makes
The Good and the Evil, which path will he take?
Both of them trying to manipulate
The use of his powers, before it's too late

Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son
Seventh son of a seventh son

Today is born the seventh one
Born of woman, the seventh son
And he in turn of a seventh son
He has the power to heal
He has the gift of the second sight
He is the chosen one
So it shall be written
So it shall be done

38,Prowler,"[Verse 1]
Walking through the city
Looking oh-so pretty
I've just got to find my way
See the ladies flashing
All their legs and lashes
I've just got to find my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Well... you see me crawling through the bushes
With it open wide
What you seeing, girl?
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it
Can't you believe your eyes?

39,Paschendale,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Intro]
In a foreign field he lay
Lonely soldier, unknown grave
On his dying words he prays
Tell the world of Paschendale
Relive all that he's been through
Last communion of his soul
Rust your bullets with his tears
Let me tell you about his years

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
Laying low in a blood filled trench
Killing time 'til my very own death
On my face I can feel the falling rain
Never see my friends again

[Verse 2]
In the smoke, in the mud and lead
Smell the fear and the feeling of dread
Soon be time to go over the wall
Rapid fire and the end of us all

[Verse 3]
Whistles, shouts and more gun fire
Lifeless bodies hang on barbed wire
Battlefield nothing but a bloody tomb
Be reunited with my dead friends soon

[Verse 4]
Many soldiers eighteen years
Drown in mud, no more tears
Surely a war no-one can win
Killing time about to begin

[Chorus]
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

[Bridge]
The bodies of ours and our foes
The sea of death it overflows
In no man's land, God only knows
Into jaws of death we go

[Verse 5]
Crucified as if on a cross
Allied troops they mourn their loss
German war propaganda machine
Such before has never been seen

[Verse 6]
Swear I heard the angels cry
Pray to God no more may die
So that people know the truth
Tell the tale of Paschendale

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 7]
Cruelty has a human heart
Every man does play his part
Terror of the men we kill
The human heart is hungry still

[Verse 8]
I stand my ground for the very last time
Gun is ready as I stand in line
Nervous wait for the whistle to blow
Rush of blood and over we go

[Bridge]
Blood is falling like the rain
Its crimson cloak unveils again
The sound of guns can't hide their shame
And so we die in Paschendale

[Verse 9]
Dodging shrapnel and barbed wire
Running straight at the cannon fire
Running blind as I hold my breath
Say a prayer symphony of death

[Verse 10]
As we charge the enemy lines
A burst of fire and we go down
I choke a cry but no-one hears
Feel the blood go down my throat

[Chorus x4]
Home, far away
From the war, a chance to live again
Home, far away
But the war, no chance to live again

See my spirit on the wind
Across the lines, beyond the hill
Friend and foe will meet again
Those who died at Paschendale",Iron Maiden,Metal
40,Can I Play with Madness,"[Intro]
Can I play with madness?

[Verse 1]
Give me the sense to wonder
To wonder if I'm free
Give me a sense of wonder
To know I can be me
Give me the strength to hold my head up
Spit back in their face
Don't need no key to unlock this door
Gonna break down the walls
Break out of this bad place

[Chorus]
Can I play with madness?
The prophet stared at his crystal ball
Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all
Can I play with madness?
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said]
I screamed aloud to the old man
I said ""Don't lie, don't say you don't know""
I say ""You'll pay for this mischief
In this world or the next""
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance
And the hell fires raged in his eyes
He said ""You wanna know the truth son?
Lord, I'll tell you the truth
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire""

Can I play with madness?

Can I play with madness?

Can I play with madness?
There's no vision there at all

41,When the Wild Wind Blows,"[Intro]

Have you heard what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard, have you heard?

He sees them in the distance
Where the darkened clouds roll
He can feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror
See an old man now
Does it matter?
They survive somehow

They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing we can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know, did you know?

As he stares across the garden
Looking at the meadows
And wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

Have you seen what they said on the news today?
Have you heard what they said about us all?

Do you know what is happening to just everyone of us?
Have you heard, have you heard?

There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it
It will never be the same
Did you know, did you know?

He carries everything into the shelter, not a fuss
Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know

They tell us nothing that we don't already know about
They tell us nothing that is real at all
They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?

He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired, that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

He sees the picture on the wall
It's falling down upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife
Roll down her face, saying grace

Remember times they had
They flash right through his mind, left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago will be gone

They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come

They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss just sit and wait

[Chorus]
I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun
Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors, unite all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome

[Chorus]

When they found them
Had their arms wrapped around each other
Their tins of poison laying nearby their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blows",Iron Maiden,Metal
42,Remember Tomorrow,"[Verse 1]
Unchain the colours, before my eyes
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher
I shall return, from out of the... Oh!

[Verse 2]
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy
Tears for somebody, but this lonely boy
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye
Flickers above us, to light up the... Sky!

43,Speed of Light,"[Verse 1]
Another time, another place
A hollow universe in space
I took a trip to see the sights
I will be blacker than the night
One way ticket, no return
My shootin' star so fast it burns
On the edge that you can't see
Let's shoot the moon, you and me
I'm not particular you see
Just a lonesome galaxy

Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

[Verse 2]
I'll say a mass for you and wave
Shootin' plasma from my grave
Event horizon lost in space
Runnin' in a human race
I don't know where I don't know when
But somehow back there time again
I'm on the edge that you can't see
I’m not particular at night
A single particle of me
You won’t be tracking me by sight

[Chorus]
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us
We slip into the night

We will not return
Humanity won't save us
At the speed of light
Shadows in the stars
We will not return
Humanity won't save us

We will not return
Humanity won't save us

44,Wrathchild,"[Verse 1]
I was born into a scene of angriness and greed
Dominance and persecution
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen
I was never meant to be
And now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around

Ahh, I'm a wrathchild
I'm coming to get you, ooh yeah, yeah

Say it doesn't matter, ain't nothin' gonna alter
The course of my destination
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind
Or I know I'll just go crazy
But now I spend my time looking all around
For a man that's nowhere to be found
Until I find him, I'm never gonna stop searching
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around

45,Strange World,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
The only place where you can dream
Living here is not what it seems
Ship of white light in the sky
Nobody there to reason why
Here I am, I'm not really there
Smiling faces ever so rare
Let's walk in deepest space
Living here just isn't the place
Oh...

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Stalks of light come from the ground
When I cry there isn't a sound
All my feelings cannot be held
I'm happy in my new strange world
Shades of green grasses twine
Girls drinking plasma wine
A look at love, a dream unfolds
Living here, you'll never grow old

Oh, baby...
Don't you hear me call?
Ooh...",Iron Maiden,Metal
46,Only the Good Die Young,"The demon in your mind will rape you in your bed at night
The wisdom of ages, the lies and outrages concealed

Time, it waits for no man
My future it is revealed
Time, it waits for no man
My fate is sealed

If I cancel tomorrow, the undead will thank me today
Fly in the face of your prophets, I mock your morality plays

The moon is red and bleeding
The sun is burned and black
The book of life is silent
No turning back

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Mystery madman, a victim of cruel charade
Some innocent pawn in an endgame, one more stalemate

Is death another birthday?
A way to kiss your dreams goodbye?
Do the undead live within us and look through our eyes?

Walking on water are miracles all you can trust
Measure your coffin, does it measure up to your lust?

So I think I'll leave you
With your bishops and your guilt
So until the next time
Have a good sin

Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
All the evil seem to live forever
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

Seven deadly sins
Seven ways to win
Seven holy paths to hell
Seven downward slopes
Seven bloodied hopes
Seven are your burning fires
Seven your desires...",Iron Maiden,Metal

Honey, it's getting close to midnight
And all the myths are still in town

Unchain your back door
Invite me around

An open mind and time to choose
Would you care to take a look
Or can you read me like a book?

Make you an offer you can't refuse

Picking up pieces of love off the floor

Picking up pieces of love, yesterday
Well, Charlotte, your drawers are off-color, too, oh

Aww, 'cause you're making...

Standing by my window, breathing summer breeze
Saw a figure floating, 'neath the willow tree
Asked us if we were happy, we said we didn't know
Took us by the hands and up we go

We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds
He could control our sense of time
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried
Everyone was in peace of mind

We felt the sensations drift inside our frames
Finding complete contentment there
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past
Just seemed to vanish in thin air

He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound
That is vibrating constantly
And if we could grip and hold on to the note
We would see our minds were free, oh they're free

Floating way up high
If you think you can find a way
You can surely try

While it feasts on flesh and blood

Angel, put sad wings around me now
Protect me from this world of sin
So that we can rise again

Oh angel, we can find our way somehow
Escaping from the world we're in
To a place where we began

15,Screaming for Vengeance,"[Verse 1]
Hey, listen, don't you let them get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right
They're playing out a game that draws you closer
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear
Always taking, baby, but that's okay
What they're giving maybe it's out of phase with me
Told you once, you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face

We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

[Verse 2]
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
All you're praying for is to stop your body breaking up
Oh, your heart is pumping, gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load

[Chorus]
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

[Verse 3]
So you wait it out and bide your time
Rip off that straight jacket, you gotta break that line
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I don't talk about it, but that's all right
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
If it takes forever, then I tell you I can wait
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate

[Chorus]
We are screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming, screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace

18,Diamonds and Rust,"[Verse 1]
I'll be damned, here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here I sit, hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Heading straight for a fall

[Chorus]
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust
Yes, we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

[Bridge]
Now I see you standing all around
And snow in your hair
Now we're smiling out the window of the crummy hotel
Over Washington Square
Our breath comes on white clouds
Mingles and hangs in the air
Speaking strictly for me
We both could've died then and there

[Verse 2]
Now you're telling me you're not nostalgic
Then give me another word for it
You were so good with words
And at keeping things vague
Cause I need some of that vagueness now
It's all come back too clearly
Yes, I love you dearly
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
I've already paid

But we both know what memories can bring
They bring diamonds and rust

Deadly as the viper peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil
Ticking like a time bomb, the fuse is running short
On the verge of snapping if it's caught

And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
It's ready to explode

Crouching in the corner wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering
Muscles are all contorted claws dug in the dirt

For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort

23,The Sentinel,"[Guitar theme]

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Along deserted avenues, steam begins to rise
The figures primed and ready, prepared for quick surprise
He's watching for a sign
His life is on the line

[Chorus]
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel

[Verse 2]
Dogs whine in the alleys, smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell, a cathedral bell begins
Ringing out its toll
A storm begins to grow

[Chorus]
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel

[Verse 3]
Amidst the upturned burned-out cars, the challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars with which to seal his fate
Across his chest in scabbards rest the rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests have finished many lives

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Now facing one another, the standoff eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls as the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers with shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless, impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory and the seeds of death he's sown

[Outro]
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel",Judas Priest,Metal
24,Raw Deal,"[Verse 1]
I made a spike about nine o'clock on a Saturday
All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar
And seeing other guys were fooling in the denim dudes
A couple cards played rough stuff, New York, fire island
I cased the joint, straining at the scenes

[Verse 2]
I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came a-grinnin'
I snapped the smile off his face and scowled ""Give me a bourbon""
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting
All the heavy bodies ducking, stealing eager for some action
The scene screwed me up, I saw some contact
Then the big boys saw me and knew that

[Bridge]
I'd had too much, floating around
Statues alive, seconds are hours

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sacks like a hurricane, wrapped in and shattered
I was barely holding on to this flying body symphony
I guess I dream in pictures, not colours
The true free expression I demand is human rights, right
I gave my life, I am immortal

I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss
I'm going, no loss

Though in our hearts we still felt pain
We're on fire but on a leash
We only ever wanted peace

[Chorus]
Never the heroes, we were made to fight
Never the heroes, we were just sacrificed at war

Like a demon leads the youth
We are terrible in truth
No time to falter, no turning back
When we come under attack

There is no question as with a friend
We have our honour to defend
We're on fire but on a leash

26,Rocka Rolla,"[Verse 1]
Man-eating momma, steam-driven hammer

But I know the flame is mine

This man will stop at nothing
To always get his way

Like a thief in the night
With the blade held tight

I won't keep in time
Tend to burn the arrow out of the line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
That's where there's thunder and the wind shouts back

Looking for meat
Grinder
Wants you to eat

Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies are my scene that's why I won't get caught
Refuse to bite the mantrap
Be led to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere

I've held my licence
It came with birth
For self-reliance on this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched upon in your game

Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
Round the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breathe
Witness from the treadmill, I take my leave

37,Prisoner of Your Eyes,"[Verse 1]
When I saw your face
I became a prisoner of your eyes
And I would do just anything
To stay and be with you
You know there are times
When I let myself wonder
As I was going under
You pulled me back to earth

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie

[Chorus]
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes

[Verse 2]
As each day goes by
I've given up completely
I've locked myself inside your heart
And thrown away the key
Only time will tell
If I can live without you
Can you see into the future?
Will you ever set me free?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie

[Chorus]
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes

In this heartache
We can try and start again
Stop the heartbreak
A little time will help to kill the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you hear me crying
Take me in your arms again
Tell me that you're trying
Or is our love a lie

[Chorus]
Love is blind
And love deceives you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
Love is blind
And love decieves you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes
Love is blind
And love decieves you
You came along and captured me
Now I'm a prisoner of your eyes
Trapped in time
I cannot leave you
I'm just a prisoner of your eyes",Judas Priest,Metal
38,Traitors Gate,"The river shows no mercy
The tower looms into my view
I sense my execution's closing
With darkness all around me
The axe is ground to end my days
The raven's cry proclaims repentance

Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Into the storm
I'm gonna win
Killer of sin
Saved by the traitors gate

A man betrayed for treason
I only wanted what was right
To bring a purpose by rebellion
The storm is soon arriving
And rain will wash away my blood
This walk of death will bring survival

Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Ready to die
Carry the day
Bury the lie
Tear down the traitors gate

Forgive me for my sins
I meant no harm to you
So let the axe man fall
To justify what I begin

Where will you be tomorrow
Now they've removed this mortal coil
I hope and pray I bring you freedom
For Honour, God and country
This world can be a better place
As I ascend from my conviction

Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
River of blood
Turning the tide
Cause of the flood
Destroying the traitors gate

Out of the dark
Into the light
Leaving my mark
Free from the traitors gate
Losing my head
Blunt  of the axe
Alive when I'm dead
Escape from the traitors gate",Judas Priest,Metal

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, makes me wonder

Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know

To be a rock and not to roll

5,Going to California,"[Verse 1]
Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank, all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching, in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers, in her hair

[Verse 2]
Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow, could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake (watch out)

[Verse 3]
Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

[Verse 4]
To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems...

For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though ""Our health"" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

[Chorus]
Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Bridge]
I tell you no lie

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

[Outro]
Ramblin', I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think ""we gots to part""
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I, I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby",Led Zeppelin,Metal
7,Dazed and Confused,"[Verse 1]
Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

[Verse 2]
You hurt and abuse telling all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, Lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again

[Extra Verse]
If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there

[Verse 3]
Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

[Bridge]
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

[Verse 1]
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration - look, see

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]

11,All My Love,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

[Verse 2]
For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now

One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you, child

His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

Oh, all of my love to you, now
All of my love, oh yes

12,The Battle of Evermore,"[Verse 1]
The Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

[Verse 2]
The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise
Waiting for the eastern glow

[Verse 3]
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow (Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back

[Outro]
At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes!
Ahhhhh
Ahhhhhhhhhh

Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Oh now, oh now, oh now, oh
Oh now, oh now, oh now

13,No Quarter,"[Verse 1]
Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step, ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you, oh

[Chorus]
They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
Oh!
The pain, the pain without quarter, oh yeah!
They ask no quarter (without quarter, quarter, quarter)
They give no quarter (giving me, giving me no...)
Oh (I hear the dogs of doom are howling more!)",Led Zeppelin,Metal

Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me

The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, oooh, oh

[Verse 2]
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
Hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so, ohhhh, oh
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh yeah
Uhh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah",Led Zeppelin,Metal
16,Over the Hills and Far Away,"[Verse 1]
Hey lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling; walk a while with me
Oh, you've got so much, so much, so much

[Verse 2]
Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied, and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Really ought to know (oh, oh, oh)
I really ought to know
Oh, you know I should, you know I should
You know I should've known",Led Zeppelin,Metal

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

18,Good Times Bad Times,"[Verse 1]
In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

[Verse 2]
Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me till the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

When my woman left home for a brown eyed man

19,Heartbreaker,"[Verse 1]
Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

[Verse 2]
Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

[Verse 4]
Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

[Verse 5]
People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

[Verse 6]
One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

20,Ten Years Gone,"[Verse 1]
Then, as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Flying skies of fortune, each a separate way
On the wings of maybe, downing birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn’t have to go
But as the eagle leaves the nest, got so far to go

[Hook]
Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad?
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had?
Do you ever remember me, baby?
Did it feel so good?
Cause it was just the first time
And you knew you would

[Verse 3]
Through the eyes and I sparkle, senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul

Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be
Oh darling, oh darling
Oh, oh darling, oh yeah, oh darling

23,Achilles’ Last Stand,"[Verse 1]
It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turned to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again

[Verse 2]
Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah

[Verse 3]
Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
Shackles of commitments fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh, to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah

[Verse 4]
To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path
That turns our feet to stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head, with heavy feet, yeah

[Guitar Solo]
Oooooh, yeah

[Verse 5]
Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow
Oh, the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again

[Verse 6]
Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth, earth

And if I say to you tomorrow
Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be

Catch the wind, see us spin, sail away, leave today
Way up high in the sky
But the wind won't blow, you really shouldn't go
It only goes to show

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be?

Hey, boy, do you wanna score?
And you know how it is?
I really don't know what time it was
Woah, oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay a while

[Verse 2]
I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me
And asked us said please, hey, would we care
To all get in line, get in line
Well, you know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh

Why don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see?

If you go down in the streets
Today, baby you better
You better open your eyes
Folk down there really don't care
Really don't care, don't care, really don't

I hate to think I've been blinded, baby
Why can't I see you tonight?
And the warmth of your smile starts a-burning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up, make it all right?

And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around

Clouds the light of the love that I found

Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found

Now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
I've got no reason to doubt you, baby
It's all a terrible mess

0,Holy Wars... The Punishment Due,"Part 1]

[Verse 1]
Brother will kill brother, spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion, something I don't understand
Fools like me who cross the sea and come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep for their beliefs, ""do you kill on God's command?""
A country that's divided surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace, no foolish naive stand
The end is near, it's crystal clear, part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel, it might be your homeland
Holy wars...

Part 2]
Upon my podium as the “know-it-all scholar”
Down in my seat of judgement, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier-than-thou-could-be-messenger of God

[Verse 3]
Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks, behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die... they die!

[Verse 4]
They killed my wife and my baby
With hopes to enslave me
First mistake... last mistake!
Paid by the alliance
To slay all the giants
Next mistake... no more mistakes!

[Guitar Solo & Instrumental Shift]

[Verse 5]
Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it don't mean I ain't thinking it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings
Mercy killings
Mercy killings, killings, killings, killings
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away",Megadeth,Metal
1,À Tout le Monde,"[Verse 1]
Don't remember where I was
I realized life was a game
The more seriously I took things
The harder the rules became
I had no idea what it'd cost
My life passed before my eyes
I found out how little I accomplished
All my plans, denied

So, as you read this, know my friends
I'd love to stay with you all

These are the last words I'll ever speak
And they'll set me free

If my heart was still alive

Moving on is a simple thing
What it leaves behind is hard
You know the sleeping feel no more pain
And the living all are scarred

This morning I made the call
The one that ends it all
Hanging up, I wanted to cry
But dammit, this well's gone dry
Not for the money
Not for the fame
Not for the power
Just no more games

[Chorus]
But now I'm safe in the eye of a tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside, in her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

[Verse 2]
You'll grow to loathe my name
You'll hate me just the same
You won't need your breath
And soon you'll meet your death
Not from the years
Not from the use
Not from the tears
Just self-abuse

But now I'm safe in the eye of a tornado
I can't replace the lies that let a thousand days go
No more living trapped inside, in her way I'll surely die
In the eye of the tornado, blow me away

Can't say what's on my mind
Can't do what I really feel
In this bed I made for me
Is where I sleep, I really feel

I warn you of the fate
Proven true too late
Your tongue twists perverse
Come drink now of this curse
And now I fill your brain
I spin you round again
My poison fills your head
As I tuck you into bed
You'll feel my fingertips
You won't forget my lips
You'll feel my cold breath
It's the kiss of death",Megadeth,Metal

What do you mean I ""don't believe in God?""

[Verse 1]
In my hour of need...
Heh, no, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
Your grace did not shine on me
Feels so cold, very cold
No one cares for me

[Verse 2]
Did you ever think I'd get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think to stop thinking?
You're the only one that I'm thinking of
You'll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too

[Verse 3]
Things will be better when I'm dead and gone
Don't try to understand
Knowing you I'm probably wrong
But, oh, how I lived my life for you
Still you'd turn away
Now, as I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
All these years I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head, raise your face, your eyes
Tell me who you think you are

[Verse 4]
I walk, I walk alone
Into the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please, God, send me on my way

[Verse 5]
Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt by fools
Alone, I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you, alone, so alone, I'm lost
Consumed by the pain
The pain, the pain, the pain
Won't you hold me again?
You just laughed... ha, ha, you bitch!
My whole life is work built on the past
But the time has come when all things shall pass
This good thing passed away

Hello me, meet the real me and my misfits way of life
A dark, black past is my most valued possession
Hindsight is always 20-20
But looking back, it's still a bit fuzzy
Speak of mutually assured destruction
Nice story, tell it to Reader's Digest

[Chorus 1]
Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me and my hair is getting thin
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm chomping at the bit and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets

[Verse 2]
Hello me, it's me again
You can subdue, but never tame me
It gives me a migraine headache, sinking down to your level
Yeah, just keep on thinking it's my fault
And stay an inch or two out of kicking distance
Mankind has got to know his limitations

[Chorus 2]
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Bloodstains on my hands and I don't know where I've been
I'm in trouble for the things I haven't got to yet
I'm sharpening the axe and my palms are getting wet
Sweating bullets

The big axe...

Well, me, it's nice talking to myself
A credit to dementia
Someday, you too will know my pain
And smile its black-toothed grin
If the war inside my head won't take a day off, I'll be dead
My icy fingers claw your back
Here I come again

[Chorus 3]
Feeling paranoid, true enemy or false friend?
Anxiety's attacking me, and my hair is getting thin
Feeling claustrophobic like the walls are closing in
Blood stains on my hands and I don't know where I've been

Once you've committed me (Committed me)
Now you've acquitted me (Acquitted me)

Tremble, you weaklings, cower in fear
I am your ruler - land, sea, and air
Immense in my girth, erect I stand tall
I am a nuclear murderer, I am Polaris
Ready to pounce at the touch of a button
My system's locked in for military gluttons
I rule on land, air, and sea
I pass judgment on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of Hell
Will we give warning? Only time will tell
Satan rears his ugly head
To spit into the wind

I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

The end doesn't scare us
When will this cease?
The warheads will all rust in peace

[Verse 2]
Bomb shelters filled to the brim
Heh, survival, such a silly whim
World leaders sell missiles cheap
Your stomach turns, your flesh creeps
I rule land, air, and sea
Pass judgment on humanity
Winds blow from the bowels of Hell
Will we give warning? Well only time will tell

[Chorus]
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

[Verse 3]
High priest of holocaust, fire from the sea
Nuclear winter, spreading disease
The day of final conflict, all pay the price
The third world war rapes peace, takes life
Back to the start, die in the pyre
When the Earth was cold as ice
Total dismay as the sun passed away
And the days were black as night

[Chorus]
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils
I spread disease like a dog, discharge my payload
A mile high, rotten egg air of death wrestles your nostrils

When will this cease?

11,Take No Prisoners,"[Verse 1]
Got one chance, (infiltrate them)
Get it right, (terminate them)
The Panzers will (permeate them)
Break their pride (denigrate them)
And their people (retrograde them)
Typhus, (deteriorate them)
Epidemic (devastate them)
Take no prisoners, (cremate them)
Burn!

[Verse 2]
Going to war, give them hell
D-Day, next stop Normandy
Beginning of the end
We know how to and sure as shit, we'll win
War is peace, sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A haven for those who walk this world bereft of heart and soul

[Verse 3]
Love and war, they say all is fair
Take his life, but won't take his hair
Your body parts your country spares
By the way son, here's your wheelchair
He once had to be all he could be
Now he's nothing for no one, nowhere to see
Funny thing, he's like you and me
It's a funny thing, funny thing
Tears streak his solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage, nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke, no one even dared
Don't ask what you can do for your country
Ask what your country can do for you

[Verse 1]
Lost in a dream, nothing's what it seems
Searching my head for the words that you said
Tears filled my eyes as we said our last goodbyes
This sad scene replays of you walking away

[Chorus]
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust

[Verse 2]
Time and again she repeats ""Let's be friends.""
I smile and say ""Yes""
Another truth bends, I must confess
I try to let go, but I know we'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again (I wish I could trust)
But I wish I could trust

[Chorus]
My body aches from mistakes
Betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much
That in nothing we trust
God, help me please, on my knees (on my knees)
Betrayed by lust (by lust)
We lied to each other so much (so much)
Now there's nothing we trust

""I'm lying when I say 'Trust me'.""
""I can't believe this is true...""

[Verse 1]
""What you don’t know,"" the legend goes, ""can't hurt you""
If you only want to live and die in fear
They tell us to believe just half of what we see
And absolutely nothing that we hear
Resist the twisted truth no matter what the cost
Supplant the rights with wrongs inside our heads
Outlawing all the questions to the answers
That no one likes when someone ends up dead

""What you don’t know,"" the legend goes, ""can't hurt you""
If you only want to live and die in a cage
There's panic and there's chaos rampant in the streets
Where useless thoughts of peace are met with rage
Demoralized and overmastered people think
The quickest way to end a war is lose
Dictatorship ends starting with tyrannicide
You must destroy the cancer at its root

If you need the strength, then conjure me

15,Hook in Mouth,"[Verse 1]
A cockroach in the concrete, courthouse tan and beady eyes
A slouch with fallen arches, purging truths into great lies
A little man with a big eraser, changing history
Procedures that he's programmed to, all he hears and sees
Altering the facts and figures, events and every issue
Make a person disappear, and no one will ever miss you

Rewrites every story, every poem that ever was
Eliminates incompetence, and those who break the laws
Follow the instructions of the New Way's Evil Book of Rules
Replacing rights with wrongs, the files and records in the schools

Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way?
Don't try to fool us, we know the worst is yet to come

F is for fighting, R is for red
Ancestors' blood in battles they've shed

16,Countdown to Extinction,"[Verse 1]
Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
An ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you man
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned...

All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction

[Verse 2]
Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt, and take your turn
Liars' anagram is ""lairs""
Man, you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous
So courageous...

All are gone, all but one

Sitting up late at night
I tiptoe through the darkness
Cold as Hell, black as spades
Aware of my immediate surroundings
In my place, I escape
Up into my hideout
Hiding from everyone
My friends all say ""Dave, you're mental anyway."" (Hey!)
Drift into a deeper state
I stalk the cobwebbed stairways
Dirt grits beneath my feet
The stair creaks, I precariously sneak, hey

[Verse 2]
Hypnosis guides my hand
I slip-slide through the walkways
Sit in Granny's rocking chair
Memories are whirling by (Yeah!)
Reminiscing in the attic
Lucretia waits impatiently
Cobwebs make me squint
The cobra so eloquently glints
Moonbeams surge through the sky
The crystal ball is energised
Surely that, like the cat
Waiting, Lucretia rocks away (Hey!)

Red flash, clouds choking out the morning sky
They said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie
All forms of life die now, the humans all succumb
Time to kiss your ass goodbye, the end has just begun

[Verse 2]
Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1999
Weeds once underneath your feet have grown to vines
Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face
No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late

[Verse 3]
The arsenal of megadeath can't be rid they said
And if it comes, the living will envy the dead
Racing for power, and all come in last
No winning, first stone cast
This falsehood, worldly peace
Its treaties soon will cease

[Verse 4]
No one will be left to prove that humans existed
Maybe soon the children will be born open-fisted
We all live on one planet it will all go up in smoke

Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy
And now the final scene, a global darkening

Killer, intruder, a homicidal man
If you see me coming, run fast as you can
Bloodthirsty demon who's stalking the street
I hack up my victims like pieces of meat
Bloodthirsty demon, sinister fiend

My hammer's a cold piece of blood-lethal steel
I grin while you writhe with the pain that I deal
Swinging the hammer, I hack through their heads
Deviant defilers, you're next to be dead

Pounding, surrounding, slamming through your head

[Verse 4]
Bodies convulse in agony and pain
I mangle their faces, 'til no features remain
A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds
First take out the organs, then cut off the head
The remains of the flesh now sop under my feet
One more bloody massacre, the murder's complete
I seek to dismember, a sadist fiend
Bloodbath's my way of gettin' clean

[Verse 5]
I lurk in the alley, wait for the kill
I have no remorse for the blood that I spill
A merciless butcher who lives underground
I'm out to destroy and I will cut you down
Cut you down

The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips
But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

[Chorus]
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry

And when the story takes a twist
It folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry

The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face

[Verse 3]
Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air

Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry again, and again and again, again

Spellbound, searching through the night
A howling man surrenders the fight

My desires of flesh obey me
The lioness will enslave me
Another heartbeat than my own

One look in her lusting eyes
Savage fear in you will rise

I miss the warm embrace I felt
First time you touched me
Secure and safe in open arms
I should have known you'd crush me
A snake you were when we met
I loved you anyway
Pulling out your poison fangs
The venom never goes away
Serpent swims free in my blood
Dragons sleeping in my veins
Jackyl speaking with my tongue
Roach egg laying in my brain

[Verse 2]
Once stalked beneath your shadow
Sleepwalking to the gallows
I'm the sun that beats your brow in
'Til I finally threw the towel in
Never knowing if I'd wake up
In a whirlpool, got redundant
My brain was just some driftwood
In a cesspool, I became dead
From a rockstar to a desk fool
Was my destiny, someone said
Love's a tide pool
Taste the water, life's abundant
Taste me!

Rise so high, yet so far to fall

Backed in a corner, caught up in the race
Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase

Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Nature's scales are forced to tip
The heartland cries, loss of all pride
To leave ain't believin', so try and be tried
Insufficient funds, insanity, and suicide

[Verse 1]
My life's on time, but again my sense is late
Feel a might unsteady, but still I have to play
Six to one's the odds and we have the highest stakes
Once again I gamble with my very life today
Highly polished metal, the oil makes it gleam
Fill the terror chamber, your mind begins to scream
Your life is like a trigger, never trouble 'til you're squeezed
Now you crack a smile as you give the gun a tease

[Verse 2]
Place the pistol down, now give the gun a spin
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in
A hateful way of vengeance, a bit of playful sin
Load another bullet, the second round begins
A couple grains of powder, a couple grams of lead
A touch against the trigger, a touch inside the head
Take another drink and raise the last bets
Think about my last words, they might be what I just said

[Verse 3]
A click comes from the hammer that couldn't drive a nail
Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades' grill
A fraction of a second, do you lose, or maybe still?
Pass it to the left, and collect your mighty kill
Add another bullet, the third round begins
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in
Please, no IOUs, no markers for death
Does anybody play? Anybody? Somebody? Anybody play?

Pain of Hook in Mouth in my Darkest Hour

May the past Rust in Peace in Hangar 18

33,Addicted to Chaos,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Only yesterday they told me you were gone
All these normal people, will I find another one?
Monkey on my back, aching in my bones
I forgot you said ""One day you'll walk alone.""
I said I need you, does that make me wrong?
Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong?
My heart was blackened, it's bloody red
A hole in my heart, a hole in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

[Chorus]
In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted, addicted to chaos

[Verse 2]
Lights shined on my path, turn bad days into good
Turn breakdowns into blocks, smashed 'cause I could
My brain was laboured, my head would spin
Don't let me down, don't give up, don't give in
The rain comes down, cold wind blows
The plans we made are back up on the road
Turn up my collar, welcome the unknown
Remember that you said ""One day you'll walk alone.""

[Pre-Chorus]
Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

[Verse 1]
Justified obliteration
No one cares anymore
The Messiah or mass murderer
No controlling who comes through the door
A culture made of cover-ups
Will leprosy touch their flesh?
For backroom meetings and rendezvous
The vultures have come home to nest

[Chorus 1]
The clock runs out
The weakest link
A deadly strike
The threat is real!

[Verse 2]
See the burnished images
Of a crest fallen agency
Violent conditioning
Caused the nature of the enemy
Your terminal lack of vision
Blinded eyes see no light
A chronic lack of perspective
Their cancer now eats us alive

[Chorus 2]
A fatal shot
A lust for blood
The final act
The threat is real!

36,Promises,"[Verse 1]
Two hearts that shouldn't
Talk to each other become close
In a town much like a prison cell
People speak our names
On the street in hushed tones
Oh, the stories they'd tell
If anyone would listen
If anyone would listen...

[Verse 2]
You come from a town where
People don't bother saying ""Hello""
Unless somebody's born or dies
And I come from a place where they
Drag your hopes through the mud
Because their own dreams are all dying

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
The sounds of the night should make us anxious
But it's much too late when the fear is gone

[Chorus]
I will meet you in the next life (I promise you)
Where we can be together (I promise you)
I will wait 'til then in Heaven (I promise you)
I promise, I promise

[Verse 3]
There's so many fighting
To get past the Pearly Gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved
Their intentions aren't that good
And I can smell the asphalt
That's their personal road to Hell being paved

[Pre-Chorus]
And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our name in rebel songs
And it's much too late when the fear is gone

[Verse 1]
The light that fills my lonely cell is blocked out by the key
That locks the door to this hell, the place they wanted me
Time's racing like the wind, execution's near
Oh, Lord, I wait for death, and yes, I have no fear
I recall that night, my every breath and step along the way
Closed my eyes, walking as danger paved the way
The Devil and the darkness, let her evil wander free
Here on Devil's Island, the final stop for me

[Chorus]
Devil's Island
Devil's Island

[Verse 2]
Oh, there is no escape, the sea is full of sharks
Tide takes you away and smash you on the rock
The sun is shining, but feel not today
Its warmth, it's dying and fading away

[Chorus]
Devil's Island
Here I stay
Devil's Island

[Verse 3]
Oh, hear the call from the grave beyond
Oh, so pernicious, her soul it creates song
As there is no man that is here upon the Earth
Able to terminate our noisome will since birth
The priest that reads the sermon is walking next to me
To the stake, my last request, to have her burn with me
But, so it did, the heavens opened, rain began to fall
The final judgment came and was spread before you all!

[Bridge]
Final judgment...

38,Family Tree,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Forgotten things remembered
The tigers eat their young
The body stayed, but inside the head
The mind was on the run
A conspiracy of silence
The only way out of pain
Is turn around, run through it, man
Too wet to come in from the rain
Tell them, ""I know they were doing it to you
But don't try doing it to me.""

[Chorus]
Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you
But keep it in the family

[Verse 2]
When you hear them saying ""Trust me""
Don't wait to see what's next
Thrown to the wolves, forever trusting
Raised in a form of living Hell
Sing a one note song of rage
Live and die within your heart
So beware in the shadows
Your family tree waits in the dark
I say, ""I know they were doing it to you
But don't try doing it to me.""
No, no...

[Chorus]
Let me show you how I love you
It's our secret, you and me
Let me show you how I love you

39,Looking Down the Cross,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Now before they take me and my blessed life
Now you'll know why Deth was summoned here tonight
I'll recall my perils; they'll kill me in pride
No, I can't run away; there's no place to hide
Whoa-oh...

[Verse 2]
Though too much to live for, I owe enough to die
Ask not for salvation, my death shall mean their lives
Hatred and guilt, the altar they've built; high priests of sin
Destiny, fate, the wicked one's gate beckoning you in
Beckoning you in

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Down the walkways, through the blood-stained town
Looking down the cross, bleeding from the crown
Led to stay, to die beside the thieves
Kill the king of the world to be

[Verse 4]
And now to you, this will come a putrefying pestilence
More noxious than the serpent's breath, malevolently destined
More corrupt than the malice of Choronzon
More disease than the wind of the moonlight sun
Putrefaction you have caused, no need for confession
Now you wish you had a god to stop your demolition
Crushing the bones of the hundred-folds
Swinging the judgement hammer
Man, woman, child, no one is safe
The heads of the dead are the banner

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
And this was all you got, so don these broken wings
The sands of time run out, bells of Hades ring
Is this a nightmare to unhallow thy name?
Smell of brimstone dancing in the flames
No help now as you fulfill his task
Chief of evil has got you by the ass
Set free to sit upon the throne
Just a dream? You're weeping all alone!

You take great pride in never having lived up to anything
Lie, steal, cheat, and kill, a real bad guy
Your daddy is a wino, and your mommy's quite insane
From altar boy to sewer rat, you don't give a damn
Your sister is a junkie, gets it anyway she can
Your brother's a gay singer in a stud leather band
Your girlfriend's got herpes to go with your Hep and AIDS
There ain't one person you know you ain't ripped off yet

[Verse 2]
Look deep in the mirror, look deep into its eyes
Your face is replaced, a creature you despise
But I know what you're made of, it ain't much I'm afraid
I know you'll be lying 'til your dying day

[Pre-Chorus]
Make up your stories, truth's so hard to say
Brain is numb and your tongue will surely dig your grave
Your mind is sickly from Alzheimer's disease
And decadence and debauchery killed your memories

Everyone can see
You're a liar, liar, liar!
It's all you'll ever be
You're a liar, liar, liar!

Start trouble, spread pain
Piss and venom in your veins
Talk nasty, breathe fire
Smell rotten, you're a liar
Sweat liquor, breathe snot
Eat garbage, spit blood
Diseased, health hazard
Scumbag, filthy bastard
Greasy face, teeth decay
Hair matted, drunk all day
Abscessed, sunken veins
Rot gut, scrambled brain
Steal money, crash cars
Rob jewelry, hock guitars
Rot in Hell, it's time you know
To your master, off you go

And the new slavery is to keep the people

How can there be any logic in biological war?
We all know this is wrong
But the New World Order's beating down the door
Oh something needs to be done

There was a king, an evil king
Who dreamt the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, no prophet could interpret
Of seven years of famine
The wolf is at my door as predicted years ago

The word predicts the future and tells the truth about the past
Of how the world leaders will hail the new Pharaoh
The eighth false king to the throne

Disengage their minds, sabotage their health
Promote sex and war and violence in the kindergartens
Blame the parents and teachers
It's their fault, ""Annuit Coeptis""

Attack the church dynamic, attack the family
Keep the public undisciplined 'til nothing left is sacred
And the ""have-not's"" get hooked
And have to go to the ""have's"" just to cop a fix

I am the king, an evil king
Who dreams the wickedest of dreams
An ancient mystery, nobody could interpret
Of seven empires falling
The wolf is at my door as predicted years ago

Shot through with corroded thread
As for me, I hocked my brains
Packed my bags and headed west

1,One,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

4,The Unforgiven,"[Verse 1]
New blood joins this Earth, and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in, this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on
He's known, ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

5,Fade to Black,"[Verse 1]
Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free

[Verse 2]
Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

[Chorus]
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

[Verse 2]
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fill his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred

On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
You don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through

But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
And most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches]
But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

[Verse 3]
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try to give away
And the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers, ringing in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said
What she said

But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again

Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some company

How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
You would just sail on

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?

And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This seeking life outside its hell

Fading in the shadows
Now a castaway
They've all gone away
They've gone away

Dear mother, dear father
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, lived my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Tear out everything inspired

Barred reality, I'm living blindly

Dear mother, dear father
Time has frozen still, what's left to be?
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

You clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled, unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

37,Eye of the Beholder,"[Verse 1]
Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination
Keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward
Seems to me absurd

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

[Chorus]
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

[Verse 2]
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both
The plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen
I see through the selfish lie

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence
Lengthen freedom's ring

Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way

A light that warms, no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day

Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence?
One step from lashing out at you
You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend
I've got more friends like you, what do I do?

Is there no standard anymore?
What it takes, who I am, where I've been, belong
You can't be something you're not

1,Cemetery Gates,"[Intro]
Reverend, Reverend, is this some conspiracy?
Crucified for no sins, an image beneath me
What's within our plans for life, it all seems so unreal
I'm a man cut in half in this world left in my misery

[Verse 1]
The Reverend he turned to me without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see, I didn't ask him why
I will remember the love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain, all my mind can see now is your

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I guess you took my youth and gave it all away
Like the birth of a new-found joy, this love would end in rage
And when she died, I couldn't cry, the pride within my soul
You left me incomplete, all alone as the memories now unfold

[Chorus]
Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me, some place far abound
I must reverse my life, I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free, belong to me at last

[Pre-Chorus]
Through all those complex years, I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around and make this world my own
And when she died, I should have cried and spared myself some pain
You left me incomplete, all alone as the memories still remain

The way we were, the chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word, I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

2,This Love,"[Verse 1]
If ever words were spoken painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life, all I wanted
Was the keeping of someone like you
As it turns out, deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you
Never ending pain, quickly ending life

[Chorus]
You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love

[Verse 2]
I'd been the tempting one stole her from herself
This gift in pain, her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you
I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

[Chorus]
You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love

Coming for you, we're the Cowboys from Hell

Oh, pillage the village, trash the scene
But better not take it out on me
'Cause a ghost town is found
Where your city used to be
So out of the darkness and into the light

From my double barrel, 12 gauge
Can't lock me in your cage

Coming for you, we're the Cowboys from Hell

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Here we come, reach for your gun
And you better listen well, my friend
You see, it's been slow down below
Aimed at you, we're the Cowboys from Hell
Deed is done, again we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales, friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Coming for you, we're the Cowboys from Hell

4,Domination,"[Intro]
(First take like a motherfucker)

[Verse 1]
Agony is the price that you'll pay in the end
Domination consumes you, then calls you a friend
It's a twisted fall
Binds are like steel and manipulates the will to be
And it's hard to see
How soon we forget when there's nothing else left to destroy
It's a useless ploy

[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall

[Chorus]
It's domination pushed into living hell
Domination

[Verse 2]
A now blacked heart is reaching out in divinity
Bodies suspended by chains over razors and nails
It's a penalty
Each razor a vice and each nail marks demise of your life
Grim construction grows
Has life played a trick?
Sealed you in brick by brick till your end
Forcing you to bend

[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes will see the dawn of the day
And the writing on the wall
Those words that stare into your soul
And to yourself you will befall

[Chorus]
It's domination pushed into living hell
Oh, domination",Pantera,Metal
5,5 Minutes Alone,"[Verse 1]
I see you had your mind all made up
You group of pitiful liars
Before I woke to face the day
Your master plan transpired
Something told me
This job has more to meet the eye
My song is not believed?
My words somewhat deceiving?
Now I'm unwhole

[Chorus]
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave the scar
You cry for compensation
I ask you please just give us
Five minutes alone
Just give us
FIve minutes alone

[Verse 2]
I read your eyes, your mind was made up
You took me for a fool
You used complexion of my skin
For a counter racist tool
You can't burn me
I've spilled my guts out in the past
Taken advantage of
'Cause you know where I come from
My past

[Chorus]
You've waged a war of nerves
But you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are
Can't leave the scar
I’ll bury your compensation
I ask you please just give us
Five minutes alone
Just give us
FIve minutes alone
Headbutt to broken glass

Five minutes alone
Just give me
I ask you please just give us

6,I’m Broken,"[Verse 1]
I wonder if we'll smile in our coffins
While loved ones mourn the day
The absence of our faces
Living, laughing, eyes awake
Is this too much for them to take?
Too young for one's conclusion, the lifestyle won
Such values you taught your son

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at me now

[Chorus 1]
I'm broken
Inherit my life
I'm broken

[Verse 2]
One day we all will die, a cliched fact of life
Force fed to make us heed
Inbred to sponge our bleed
Every warning, a leaking rubber
A poison apple for mingled blood
Too young for one's delusion, the lifestyle cost
Venereal mother embrace the loss

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That's how, that's how, that's how
Look at you now

[Chorus 2]
You're broken
Inherit your life
You're broken

Look at us now

Nailed to the cross

Wash away us all
Take us with the flood

Then throughout the night they were raped and executed

Wash away us all
Take us with the flood

8,Hollow,"[Verse 1]
What's left inside him?
Don't he remember us?
Can't he believe me?
We seemed like brothers
Talked for hours last month
About what we wanna be
I sit now with his hand in mine
But I know he can't feel

[Hook]
No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

[Verse 2]
I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

[Hook]
No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

[Chorus]
He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone now

[Verse 3]
He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul
He sees no love
I shake my fists at skies above
Mad
At God
Mad

[Verse 4]
He as hollow as I converse
I wish he'd waken from this curse
Hear my words before it's through
I want to come in after you

Best friend
My
Best friend
Whoa yeah
Come back!

He as hollow as I alone now

9,Mouth for War,"[Verse 1]
Revenge, I'm screaming revenge again
Wrong, I've been wrong for far too long
Been constantly so frustrated
I've moved mountains with less
When I channel my hate to productive
I don't find it hard to impress

[Pre-Chorus]
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

[Chorus]
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for
Speak the truth about me
Determined

[Verse 2]
Possessed, I feel a conquering will down inside me
Strength, the strength of many to crush who might stop me
My strength is in number
And my soul lies in every one
The releasing of anger can better any medicine under the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
Bones in traction
Hands break to hone raw energy
Bold and disastrous
My ears can't hear what you say to me

[Chorus]
Hold your mouth for the war
Use it for what it's for

[Bridge]
There comes a time within everyone
To close your eyes to what's real

[Outro]
No comprehension to fail
I vacuum the wind for my sail
Can't be the rest
Let others waste my time
Owning success is the bottom line
Like a knife into flesh
After life is to death
Pulling and punching the rest of duration
No one can piss on this determination",Pantera,Metal
10,Suicide Note Pt. I,"[Verse 1]
Cheap cocaine, a dry inhale
The pills that kill and take the pain away (Take the pain away)
Diet of life, shelter without
The face that cannot see inside yours and mine (Yours and mine)

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm hiding
When I need it, it lets me breathe
For our handle on this life
I don't believe this time

[Chorus]
Would you look at me now? (Would you look at me now?)
Can you tell I'm a man? (Can you tell I'm a man?)
With these scars on my wrists
To prove I'll try again

[Post-Chorus]
Try to die again
Try to live through this night
Try to die again

[Verse 2]
Forever fooling, free and using
Sliding down the slide that breaks a will (Breaks a will)
Mother's angel, getting smarter
How smart are you to regress unfulfilled?
(How smart are you to regress unfulfilled?)
It's a damn shame

When I'm hiding
When I need it, it lets me breathe
For our handle on this life
I don't believe this time

11,Fucking Hostile,"[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Almost every day
I see the same face
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe what's evil
Is making love and making friends
And meeting God your own way, the right way

[Chorus]
To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Ah, fucking hostile!
We stand alone

[Verse 2]
The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped they ran
Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me, I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a God

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Ah, fucking hostile!
We stand alone

Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven, hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching, say your prayers
'Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
About to take the ultimate test in life
I question things because I am human
And call no one my father who's no closer that a stranger
I won't listen

To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us

Out of my mind, gun up to the mouth
No pretension, execution
Live and learn, rape and turn
Fret not family, nor pre-judged army
This is for me, and me only
Cowards only try it

[Chorus]
Don't you try to die, like me
It's livid and its lies and makes graves descending

[Verse 2]
It's not worth the time to try
To replenish a rotting life
I'll end the problem, facing nothing
Fuck you off, fuck you all
Tortured history, addict of misery, this exposes me
For weakness is a magnet - watch me do it, do it

[Chorus]
Don't you try to die, like me
It's livid and it's lies
Makes graves descending down

[Verse 3]
Why would you help anyone who doesn't want it?
Doesn't need it, doesn't want your shit advice
When a mind's made up to go ahead and die
What's done is done and gone, so why cry?

Tortured history, addict of misery, this exposes me
For weakness is a magnet - watch me do it, do it, do it

13,10's,"[Verse 1]
My skin is cold
Transfusion with somebody
Morose and old
Drop into fruitless dying

The whoring angel rising
Now burning prayers
My silent time of losing

My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

Long for the blur
We cannot dry much longer
Cement to dirt
Disgusted with my cheapness

My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself

Colliding slow, like life itself
My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself
My foes - they can't destroy my body
Colliding slow, like life itself",Pantera,Metal

New life in place of old life
Unscarred by trials

Dominate and take the motherfucking world

Mass prediction, unification
Breathing life into our lungs
Every creed and every kind
To give us depth for strength
Taught when we're young to hate one another
It's time to have a new reign of power
Make pride universal so no one gives in

Then when confronted we ask them the question
What's wrong with their mind?
What's wrong with your mind?

We've lived with past mistakes
And we've lived with our own

Then flaunt it like you did create

If I hit bottom and everything's gone
In the great Mississippi, please drown me and run

It's digging time again
You're nurturing the weakest trend

A long time ago I never knew myself
Then the memory of shame birthed its gift
No more the small one, the weak one, the frightened one
Running from beatings, deflating
I'm becoming more than a man, more than you ever were
Driven and burning to rise beyond Jesus

I'm born again with snakes eyes
Becoming Godsize

I found my life was slipping through my hands
Perhaps through death my life won't be so bad

Belittle your friends to serve me, to suck me
To realize my saving grasp
I of suicide, I the unlord

I fucked your girlfriend last night
While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love
She called me Daddy
And I called her baby when I smacked her ass
I called her sugar when I ate her alive till daylight
And I slept with her all over me
From forehead to rib cage I dripped her ass
Sometimes I thought you might be spying
Living out some brash fantasy, but no
You were knocked out
But we were all knocked out you know
In a way

I'm out of my fucking mind
I serve too many masters

We didn't know you'd break the bottle
That the magic came in to use those jagged shards
To cut our wrists and neck
And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude
But you wouldn't know what you were doing
Because I didn't
Your girlfriend could have been a burn victim
An amputee, a dead body
But god damn I wanted to fuck

I'm losing what's left of my fucking mind
I serve too many fucking masters
I fucking told you
I'm losing that fucking every fucking bit

19,No Good (Attack the Radical),"[Verse 1]
In the states there's a problem with race
Because of ignorant past burnt fires
From evolution we've been killing each other
I figure man should have it down to a science
No chance, not for a minute, not for a second
I won't be defensive
I'm straight out in my opinion
You'd better listen to a man
Who knows what he's saying
I've seen your side, you run and hide
For the mere fact that you feel inferior
Be superior and know your interior

Race, pride, prejudice
Black man, white man, no stand
Live in the past, we make it last

No solution, mind pollution

So low behold my eyes
This land of fools will rise
No good for no-one
You're no good for no-one

You blame oppression and play the role of criminals
To rape and burn shows progress is minimal
White hoods and militants, you know it's such a pity
Living, breathing, violence in your city
If one man had one home in one world
He'd live alone without variety, full of anxiety
No-one to point at, question or even talk to in his private grave
No matter what colour, he wouldn't be saved from Hell, he dwells
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells

Race, pride, prejudice

There is nothing
No education

I'll be broke in a gutter
I know the opinion
A broken record
Fuck you and your college dream
Fact is we're stronger than all

You're working for perfect bodies
Perfect minds and perfect neighbors
But I'm helping to legalize dope on your pristine streets
And I'm making a fortune
You're muscle and gall
Naive at best
I'm bone, brain and cock
Deep down stronger than all

A crippled America
A pipe dream
Buttfucked

He holds out his hand on your television and
Draws back a stump

Far too late!

22,Drag the Waters,"[Verse 1]
A smack on the wrists is the words
From the mouth of the outsiders, lawyers, police
A small price to pay for the dope and the guns and the rape
It should all be O.K
Your father is rich, he's the judge, he's the man
He's the God that got your sentence reduced
But in the back of his mind, he well knows
What he'd find if he looked a little deeper in you
In you

Drag the waters some more
Like never before

Sweet is the slice and the lips
You're going to have that woman
She is your favorite lay
Promised you swore that no one had been there, and
She was going to keep it that way
Let it move in, you got thin, and got high, and
Your money went and so did your friends
But she's by your side, and her smile cannot hide
The premonition of the beckoning end
The end

Expect the worse, you bleeding heart
But kill me first before it starts
Yes, my cock is getting hard

I don't want you to look at me while
I'm shedding skin
I can't afford for you to see what's in
I'd rather shoot myself than have you watch me
I feel you'd steal my skin to try and wear me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was betrayed, one more day of my short life
You were carried away, had no shame
To suffocate my being
I was me, but you weren't you
You were sticking to me like a scab
So I peeled you away, bled for days
Then stepped out of myself

[Chorus]
I'm shedding skin, changing within, falling in
Through swollen eyes I dreamed you died, caught inside
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem
Created the end, killing a friend
I'm shedding my skin

[Verse 2]
I don't think you belong in here, I feel I'm sick
Don't ask, cause you know damn well where I've been
I've kept a simple woman through the thick and thin
But I've found the guts to sever from my Siamese twin

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I throw you away, every day
A dead part of life
Strangling back, seething black
In between my longing for torture
Blood on my face that came from your face
A mix of kissing and bleeding
I put you away, I shut you away
I pissed you away, I threw you away

[Chorus]
I'm shedding skin, changing within, falling in
Through swollen eyes I dreamed you died, caught inside
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem
Created the end, killing a friend
I'm shedding my skin

[Verse 3]
You're fucking and sucking
You're friendless, it's endless
Your flower has soured
It's endless, you're friendless
It's harder and stronger
But no-one's been inside you longer
And harder and deeper
To get you off, you need the fear
The fear, the fear, the fear, the fear
It's never love, bloody touch
Broken wrist, needle rust
Choking throat, swallowed teeth
Head fuck, no peace

[Refrain 1]
I'm shedding my skin
To peel you off of me
You've got to love me

There's a double standard for the way we live
If there's nothing to have, well then there's nothing to give

What you'd kill to see brings out the God in me

Come and be with me
Live my twisted dream
Pro devoted pledge

Will always be the one to tell you when to quit

Outbreak of gun roulette
The cross slants to the side

Awaits with cancerous breath

There's Holy streets to roam

It's a safe assumption
You'd want to save me now
I'll never face castration
For your sacred sow is left
Slaughtered, slaughtered

Brainwashed by me
Myself influence I
Bird brained, world saver
Fake God dead inside you

It's a safe assumption
You'd want to save me now
I'll never face castration
For your sacred sow is left
Slaughtered, slaughtered

[Bridge - Sung, Lyrics Excluded From Song]
System destroyed, exposed and unployed
The fruit of intention
Cry for their dead, but turning their head to ignore reality's claw
Knife to your wrist, syringe in your arm is your ounce of prevention
Give what you made and
Under your name on your grave is salvation
A big fucking joke
Slaughter the pig, the self righteous king for your own restoration
God is in your chest and faith kills what is precious
For death is unanswered

[Chorus]
Slaughtered, slaughtered

As a child I was given the gift to entertain you
But through blood I inherited a life that could destroy you
I drink all day, I smoke all day
I took Madonna's breath away
I've done it all but tap the vein
These hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons
All these Christians come alive and try to sell you

[Chorus]
My soul for a goat
Yet I'll outlive the old

[Verse 2]
You know it's bad, some may say sad
A hangover is inspiration
Like a junkie I hurt for it
A bad trip, the emptiness
I never sleep or always sleep
A lack of fulfillment to me is me
The big picture
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
Are part of what the Christians mean
To immortalize my situation

[Chorus]
My soul for a goat
Yet I'll outlive the old

[Bridge]
Embrace some religion
To get close to some undivine ejaculation point
Simply to thy ghost I cling
Simply to thy ghost I reject
Simply to thy ghost I give spit

Tempter, tempting, tempt me, molest me
You know that I'll submit
For this is my weakness
And it saves me from relationships

Boy in a pocket
Balls in a bag

A faster way to kill them all would
Take too goddamn long

30,The Underground in America,"[Chorus]
Put in position to wage teenage mayhem
A common affair for the ones who are juiced
If it is weakness that grants us the power
We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world

[Verse 1]
Glass breaks, the dimming lights
Sweat, heat and profane debate
The smart ones stay on the outside
While drunken heads and arms erupt
Centered man swings a punch
Spits a tooth, postures odd
A punk rock escapade
Five bucks a head to be king dick in the crowd
We are the ones who must sport the position
Cheap beer, trendy clicks
Lesbian love is accepted and right
Shaved heads meet hair in the mix
Blending the 80's and 90's with hate

[Chorus]
Put in position to wage teenage mayhem
A common affair for the ones who are juiced
If it is weakness that grants us the power
We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world

[Verse 2]
Shows on, dates canceled
Kicked out for reasons that seem so unfair
Skin crusts against the cops
A foregone conclusion that's tired and beat
Ringworm, crabs and lice
V.D., ecstasy, speed and horse
A heaven of unmatched importance
An honor of sex to be stuck by the punk
We are the ones who must sport the position
Rich homes with money and food
Abandoned for the bums on the street
A lifestyle that's unexplainable
Don't try and save what is all meant to be

[Chorus]
Put in position to wage teenage mayhem
A common affair for the ones who are juiced
If it is weakness that grants us the power
We thrive on what's stronger than most of the world

[Verse 3]
If it is free, from a family that's seen
You can just keep it
If you must beg, it's better instead
You must follow the etiquette
Fake! Fake! Fake! Fake!
You know when it rains you're in your bed at home
You act so real when you are alone
Fake! Fake! Fake! Fake!
You better not let the mohawked crowd see
Haha, ah fuck
Give it five years, you'll retire your piercings
You must admit that you mimic the weaklings

I vent my frustration at you old man
After years your ears will hear
You screamed you tried
It's words of a weakling
And promises made by a liar, drunken liar
Now you pick up that splintered chair
That was aiming for your head
A head that should have been long ago kicked in by me
Alone
I won't lose a second of sleep for this
Not again

[Chorus]
Don't touch me
No!
Ever again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me

[Verse 2]
Orphaned to the dope and drinks
I learned my lesson well, somehow from you
No tears. Can't clutch my regrets
But these years of detachment
Have left me with demons now surfacing
I'm becoming more than nothing
You never knew the answers to any of my questions, did you?
You made up all the answers to my unimportant existence
But now you don't have to dump me off

Not again
Don't touch me
Don't touch me

You'll never be the father I am
The bastard father to the thousands
Of the ugly, criticized, the unwanted
The ones with fathers just like you

I'm shoving my life right down your throat
Can I find the guts?
Can I feel the heart?
Look at the ground as you choke me up
Does it taste like tequila?
Or failure?

There is a part of me that's always sixteen
I've found the secret of eternal youth
Some get high on life or money, but there's an escape
Drop out of the race

To walk through the world by oneself
You can't be protected
Your trust is in whiskey and weed and Black Sabbath

The weight of the world has lifted and parted

Through tunnel-vision and dope-hair blinders
I'll cut a path and evoke my will

You can't be protected
Your trust is in whiskey and weed and Slayer

Don't waste your time, embrace it

Will focus the mind's eye

Rejuvenated, isolated, no pressure
From the outside, my sight's goddamn electric
And these eyes have seen a world
Goddamn electric system

We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs
The moon in silver trees
Falls down in tears

Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight breaks down the night
And so we pass on by the crimson eye
Of great god Mars

Can't tell the strangers from the friends you know

Half assed for most his life
Done nothing but stand
Talks big ‘cause he's so small so
No one will give him a hand
The kind of guy that would steal your cash
And buy a burning house
Then call you up and invite you in
And jerk you off with a sandpaper hand

[Chorus]
I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool
I'd stomp his ass for free
Because a punk like that is piss in the wind
Piss in the wind

[Verse 2]
A go-getter who ain't got none
A legend in his mind
Always the one to invite himself
And then gets left behind
Someone must've clipped his balls
Or wiped his ass all his life
A self-centered procrastinator
Attention seeker who's got nothing at all

[Chorus]
I'd leave him physically crippled
Without a leg to stand
I'd throw that trash away
Because a runt like that is piss in the wind
My fist would be the decider
I wasn't raised a fool

When I die for my future's
Laid out for me

Rise above the lies
Morals on a backwards globe
A sin to you

Act this way

Because religion gives them

Young and dumb, truth and justice, fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off then you look away
Do you think this corruption will ever stop
What makes a person want to be a cop
Ran a red light, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry
Pick up a hooker and take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side
Sworn to serve and protect, forget the killing
Badge-wearing fascist villain
Pissed in the street, you bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry

The badge means you suck
A child lies there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head
Some still call him a pig
Some still call him a pig

[Verse 2]
Young and tough, truth and justice, fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off then you look away
He burned a flag, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry
Ran a red light, take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side

[Chorus]
The badge means you suck
A child lays there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head

[Outro]
Talk to them, you can work it out
You better not even try it
You make a play for his gun
They'll kill you say it was a riot
RIOT
What's behind the badge?

You crazy son of a bitch!
Fucking son of a bitch!

Many distant miles away
Past the shores of ever dark
There stays a magic man
Who bears an evil mark
He helps all concerned
Those who come again return
Injecting lies while fires burn
The devil's heart
With angel's words

[Half-Verse 1]
Have you wondered what heaven's like?
He can show you in one night
Overwhelming with euphoric lift
To lure you, to steal your gift

Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go

Understand, just take his hand
He's the medicine man
Understand, just take his hand

[Verse 2]
Once proud and fearless men
With desire in their eyes
Lost strong and fruitful lives
To self-indulgent ties
Their souls were dipped in venom
And put into a box
Then placed upon a crowded shelf
Where countless souls now rot

Have you ever wondered what hell's like?
He can take you there
Just one taste and you'll be back
And by the high you'll swear

Families are dying

There's a place that I keep deep inside me
It can trigger my mind
All along I knew it has been with me
Since I was just a child
I just summon power within my soul
It has given me life, beyond life
I take blame for my murderous problem

Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain
And your godforsaken ending to life

Brutal time after time

Slay in different designs

No one cares to understand my demented means
Sticks and stones can break all your brittle bones

Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain

Auschwitz, the meaning of pain
The way that I want you to die
Slow death, immense decay
Showers that cleanse you of your life

Your life's worth
Human mice, for the angel of death
Four hundred thousand more to die

Angel of death
Monarch to the kingdom of the dead

Sadist of the noblest blood
Destroying, without mercy

Monarch to the kingdom of the dead
Infamous butcher
Angel of death

Pumped with fluid, inside your brain
Pressure in your skull begins pushing through your eyes
Burning flesh drips away
Test of heat burns your skin, your mind starts to boil
Frigid cold cracks your limbs
How long can you last
In this frozen water burial?
Sewn together, joining heads
Just a matter of time
'Till you rip yourselves apart
Millions laid out in their
Crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve
The Holocaust

Seas of blood, bury life
Smell your death as it burns
Deep inside of you
Abacinate, eyes that bleed
Praying for the end of
Your wide awake nightmare
Wings of pain, reach out for you
His face of death staring down
Your blood's running cold
Injecting cells, dying eyes
Feeding on the screams of
The mutants he's creating
Pathetic harmless victims
Left to die
Rancid angel of death
Flying free

A lifeless object, alive
Awaiting reprisal
Death will be their acquittance

Holds the key to his own death

Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind

Another casualty, beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the fate you feel draws near
Fatality, reality, await the final call

I've seen it many times
Your tortured screams
Your decrepit little mind
A father's son
With pathetic eyes that bleed
Twins in the end
Begin and let the brothers fall

[Chorus 1]
I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will hunt you down again for Him

[Verse 2]
God won't judge what I've done
He crawls upon my feet
A privileged pain
Beneath buried are your dead
On splintered bones I walk
Sifting through the blood
Besieged to fear
Await the coming of the God

[Chorus 2]
I will watch you die again for Him

[Verse 3]
Blood is raining downward
The stain reflects the sun
Conquer divide within
Terrorize the mind
I've seen the end it's yours
Rosary in hand
Your selfish flesh it melts
Spilling from the sky

[Chorus 3]
I will see you burned alive
Screaming for your God
I will watch you die

[Hook]
This is God's war
God's war
This is God's war
God's war

[Verse 4]
War of holy principles
I'm seeking God's help in your destruction
Slit the throat of heathen man
And let his blood dilute the water
Bury your dead

[Verse 5]
Fuck your God erase his name
A lady weeps insane with sorrow
I'll take his towers from the world
You're fucking raped upon your deathbed

[Outro]
Be optimistic, happy, and calm
Show no fear or anxiety
Smile at the face of God
And your reward will be eternity
Holy warriors, your patience will be justified
Everything is for Him
You must not comfort the animal before you kill it
Strike as champions at the heart of the nonbelievers
Strike above the neck and at all extremities
For it's a point of no return for Almighty God
God will give victory to his faithful servants
When you reach ground zero you will have killed the enemy
The great Satan",Slayer,Metal

Sexual release buried deep inside
Complete control of a prized possession
To touch and fondle with no objection
Lonely souls an emptiness fullfilled
Physical pleasure and addictive thrill
An object of perverted reality
An obsession beyond your wildest dreams

Death loves final embrace
Your cool tenderness
Memories keep love alive
Memories will never die

The excitement of dissection is sweet
My skin crawls with orgasmic speed
A lifeless object for my subjection
An obsession beyond your imagination
Primitive instinct a passion for flesh
Primal feeding on the multitudes of death
Sadistic acts a love so true
Absorbingly masticating a part of you

Death loves final embrace
Your cool tenderness
Memories keep love alive
Memories will never die

I need a friend
Please be my companion
I don't want to be
Left alone with my sanity

Erotic sensations tingle my spine
A dead body lying next to mine
Smooth blue black lips

What's become of me
Here I stand

Arrogance has won
Annihilation must be swift
Destroy without destruction

Mummified regions lying in dust
Fall victim to this game
Petrified corpses bathing in rust
Taken without being blamed
Falsified spirits, farther they fall
Soon they will join us in hell

And fools became the wise
Memories linger in my brain
Burning from the acid rain
A pain I never have won

Convicted witch, my life will end
At midnight on the stake
My dedicated life was spent
To insubordinate
Secured, by lock, inside a cell
Imprisoned for no crime
These shackles will be useless
When your life is out of time

Incantation spell gone by

My deals were made eternally
I signed the book of red
My rage will be unleashed again
Burning the next morn
Death means nothing, there's no end
I will be reborn

No gift of exile in my fate
I'll get no amnesty
I can't control my destiny
There is no habitual need
Proclaim my death, to end my wrath
It takes more than one try
Indulge your ineffective curse
I will never die

[Chorus 2]
You think by killing me tonight
My powers will not rise
There'll be nowhere for you to run
When hatred comes to life
Condemned to fill the prophecy
Allowing no first born
Defy your morbid declaration
Leave you ripped and torn

Count your blessing, would-be priest
As I burn upon the stake
You'd be forgiven endlessly

Am I superstitious?

Taking flight amidst the night

Leaving corpses waiting for the change

38,God Send Death,"[Verse 1]
On your back, look on to me
You'll see genocide
Face from death, more than insane
Profane, pleading cries
Watch you die inside, watch you die

[Chorus 1]
God send death and misery
Preach no love of ministry
Pray for sin, a shattered faith
Down on your knees
You're screaming out to die

[Post-Chorus]
Death is overdue
Nothing can save you
A morbid symphony
Hearing you lie there screaming (out to die)
Taking life from you
Is all I wanna do
Desire so deranged
This is what lives inside me

Putrid blood flows through my veins
To thrive on demise
Voyeurs lust, watching the pain
Touching you inside
Bleed you fucking dry
Bleed on me

Death's design, blood-splattered wall
Face melting, one vicious whore
Twisted figures, flesh from bone
Down on your knees
You're screaming out to die

Hearing you lie there screaming (out to die)
Taking life from you

Clawing at the eyes of God
You taste your death in hand
Your fingers bleed in vain

You've gone insane with pain
You're blind, screaming for your God (pathetic God)

39,When the Stillness Comes,"[Verse 1]
Blood was like paste on the walls
Bodies lay lifeless like dolls
A moment that felt like days
Lives extinguished in a rage
So nauseous I don't realize
Incessantly feeding the flies
In the moment of visceral haze
The last thing you see are my crazed eyes
The last thing you see are my eyes

[Verse 2]
Fear lies beneath your facade
In panic you scream for your God
No way I'll ever abstain
Blood falls from the ceiling like rain
Patiently unleash my violence
Ingesting the sweet sound of your silence
In darkness this feeling I love
To be covered in blood... blood from above

[Bridge]
This violence finally sets me free
Brings demons back to torture me
There's no god pulling at my strings
I'm above all sorrow faith can bring

Disengaged I see your face
An adrenaline rush I can't replace
Hands around your neck
Your senses numb
Staring into your eyes when the stillness comes",Slayer,Metal

Through the night we rise in pairs
Lords of night, we ride
From the depths of Hell's domain
Reborn to reign this night
Roam throughout the endless wars
Hold high his name, we must
Warriors from the gates of Hell
In Lord Satan we trust

[Chorus 1]
Stalking the night, can't you feel I am near
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing their fate

Brothers of the prince of night
By bargains we have made
Allies with the darkened souls
Our legions, we must save
Fight for our eternal quest
God can't save you in time
Evil stalks the night with us
Your soul, it shall be mine

Stalking the night, can't you feel I am near
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night
Attack those not knowing my force

[Bridge]
I am the menace in your eyes
The one you can't escape
Your life falls in my grasp
You know your end is near
You pray your God will help
His strength, no match for mine
Your last hope slips away
Thy soul begins to bleed
I tear your flesh to shreds
Burn holes throughout your mind
Your eyes now filled with blood
A victim of my force
In endless agony
You realize your defeat
Recite my master's chants
Your soul now his to keep

Stalking the night, can't you feel I am near
Watching each step that you take
I take lives and show all no mercy this night

41,Dittohead,"This fucking country's lost it's grip
Sub-conscious hold begins to slip
The scales of justice begin to tip

The legal system has no spine
It's corroding from inside
Slap your hand and you'll do no time

Reality on vacation
All across a blinded nation
Mentally under sedation

Anyone can be set free
On a technicality
Explain the law again to me

Here in 1994
Things are different than before
Violence is what we adore

Invitation to the game
Guns and blades and media fame
Every day more of the same

Murder, mayhem, anarchy
Now are all done legally
Mastermind your killing spree

Unafraid of punishment
With a passive government
There's nothing for you to regret

Nothing to regret

Unimposing policy
No enforcing ministry
Gaping with judicial flaws
Watch a fading nation crawl

Clashing with the public's frame
I'm the one that's place in fame
Legislature sets the stage
Social slaves caught in my rage
Administrative anarchy there's nothing
You can do to me

Your perfect world is ending today
So what? I wouldn't have it any other way

You panic lit the fuel; now it's you against you

Has burned a hole between us so

No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication

The poetry that comes from the squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance

There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smoldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication

Cold silence has a tendency to
Atrophy any sense of compassion

Say the word and we'll be
Well upon our way
Blend and balance
Pain and comfort deep within you
'Til you will not want me any other way

[Chorus]
It's not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I said I don't want it
I just need it
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive

[Post-Chorus]
Knuckle deep inside the borderline
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to
Relax, slip away

[Bridge]
Something kinda sad about
The way that things have come to be
Desensitized to everything
What became of subtlety?
How can this mean anything to me
If I really don't feel anything at all?
I'll keep digging
'Til I feel something

Elbow deep inside the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Shoulder deep within the borderline

9,Rosetta Stoned,"[Intro]
Alrighty, then
Picture this if you will

[Verse 1]
10 to 2 AM, X, Yogi DMT, and a box of Krispy Kremes
In my ""need to know"" pose, just outside of Area 51
Contemplating the whole ""chosen people"" thingy
When just then a flaming stealth banana split the sky
Like one would hope but never really expect to see in a place like this
Cutting right angle donuts on a dime
And stopping right at my Birkenstocks
And me yelping, ""holy fucking shit!""
Holy fucking shit!
Holy fucking shit!
Holy fucking shit!
Holy fucking shit!
Holy fucking shit!
Holy fucking shit!

[Verse 2]
Then the X-File being
Looking like some kind of blue-green Jackie Chan
With Isabella Rossellini lips, and breath that reeked of
Vanilla Chig Champa
Did a slow-mo Matrix descent
Outta the butt end of the banana vessel
And hovered above my bug-eyes, my gaping jaw
And my sweaty L. Ron Hubbard upper lip
And all I could think was
""I hope Uncle Martin here doesn't notice
That I pissed my fuckin' pants""

[Verse 3]
So light in his way, like an apparition, that
He had me crying out
""Fuck me, it's gotta be
The Deadhead Chemistry
The blotter got right on top of me
Got me seein' E-motherfuckin'-T!""

[Verse 4]
And after calming me down
With some orange slices
And some fetal spooning
E.T. revealed to me his singular purpose
He said, ""You are the chosen one
The one who will deliver the message
A message of hope for those who choose to hear it
And a warning for those who do not""
Me, the chosen one
They chose me
And I didn't even graduate from fuckin' high school

[Refrain]
You'd better
You'd better
You'd better
You'd better listen

[Verse 5]
Then he looked right through me
With somniferous almond eyes
Don't even know what that means
Must remember to write it down
This is so real
Like the time Dave floated away
See, my heart is pounding
'Cause this shit never happens to me

[Verse 6]
I can't breathe right now!
It was so real
Like I woke up in Wonderland
All sorta terrifying
I don't wanna be all alone
While I tell this story
And can anyone tell me why
You all sound like Peanuts parents?
Will I ever be coming down?
This is so real
Finally, it's my lucky day
See, my heart is racing
'Cause this shit never happens to me

[Verse 7]
I can't breathe right now
You believe me, don't you?
Please believe what I've just said!
See the Dead ain't touring
And this wasn't all in my head
See, they took me by the hand
And invited me right in
Then they showed me something
I don't even know where to begin

[Chorus]
Strapped down to my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Overwhelmed as one would be, placed in my position
Such a heavy burden now to be the one
Born to bear and bring to all the details of our ending
To write it down for all the world to see
But I forgot my pen
Shit the bed again
Typical

[Chorus]
Strapped down to my bed
Feet cold and eyes red
I'm out of my head
Am I alive? Am I dead?
Sunkist and Sudafed
Gyroscopes and infrared
Won't help, I'm brain dead
Can't remember what they said
God damn, shit the bed

[Verse 8]
I can't remember what they said to me
Can't remember what they said to make me out to be the hero
Can't remember what they said
Bob help me!
Can't remember what they said

We barely remember
Who or what came before this precious moment
We are choosing to be here right now

We are eternal, all this pain is an illusion",Tool,Metal
11,Right in Two,"[Verse 1]
Angels on the sideline
Puzzled and amused
Why did Father give these humans free will?
Now they're all confused

[Chorus 1]
Don't these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go around?
Plenty in this holy garden, silly monkeys
Where there's one you're bound to divide it
Right in two

[Verse 2]
Angels on the sideline
Baffled and confused
Father blessed them all with reason
And this is what they choose?
(This is what they choose)

[Chorus 2]
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they forge a blade
And where there's one they're bound to divide it
Right in two
Right in two

[Chorus 3]
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground
Silly monkeys, give them thumbs, they make a club and beat their brother down
How they've survived so misguided is a mystery
Repugnant is a creature who would squander the ability
To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here

[Bridge 1]
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two
Cut and divide it all right in two

Fight over the clouds, over wind, over sky and
Fight over life, over blood, over air and light
Over love, over sun, over another

Benched along with patience and reason

Beating tired bones again
Age-old battle, mine

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate
Desperate to control all and everything
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen

Otherwise, it all comes down
Justify denials and
Grip 'em to the lonesome end
Clutch it like a cornerstone
Otherwise, it all comes down
Terrified of being wrong

Hang on or be

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate

Wear the grudge like a crown
Desperate to control
Unable to forgive and sinking deeper
Defining, confining

Controlling, defining
And we're sinking deeper

Saturn comes back around to show you everything
Lets you choose what you will not see and then
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent

Saturn comes back around
Lifts you up like a child
Or drags you down like a stone
To consume you 'til you
Choose to let this go

Let the oceans take and transmutate
This cold and fated anchor
Give away the stone
Let the waters kiss and transmutate

15,Vicarious,"[Verse 1]
Eye on the TV, 'cause tragedy thrills me
Whatever flavor it happens to be like
""Killed by the husband""
""Drowned by the ocean""
""Shot by his own son""
""She used a poison in his tea
Then kissed him goodbye""
That's my kind of story
It's no fun 'til someone dies
Don't look at me like I am a monster
Frown out your one face, but with the other
Stare like a junkie into the TV
Stare like a zombie while the mother holds her child
Watches him die
Hands to the sky cryin', ""Why, oh why?""

[Chorus]
'Cause I need to watch things die
From a distance
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
You all need it too, don't lie

[Verse 2]
Why can't we just admit it?
Why can't we just admit it?
We won't give pause until the blood is flowin'
Neither the brave nor bold
Nor brightest of stories told
We won't give pause until the blood is flowin'

I need to watch things die
From a good safe distance
Vicariously, I live while the whole world dies
You all feel the same, so
Why can't we just admit it?

Credulous at best, your desire to believe in
Angels in the hearts of men
Pull your head on out your hippie haze and give a listen
Shouldn't have to say it all again
The universe is hostile, so impersonal
Devour to survive, so it is, so it's always been

The musicians who've made all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years... real fucking high on drugs.""

Dreaming of that face again
It's bright and blue and shimmering
Grinning wide
And comforting me with its three warm and wild eyes

On my back and tumbling
Down that hole and back again (And back again)
Rising up
And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye

[Refrain]
In, out, in, out, in, out

[Verse 3]
A child's rhyme stuck in my head
It said that life is but a dream
I've spent so many years in question
To find I've known this all along

[Chorus]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running?

[Verse 4]
Shrouding all the ground around me
Is this holy crow above me
Black as holes within a memory
And blue as our new second sun
I stick my hand into the shadow
To pull the pieces from the sand
Which I attempt to reassemble
To see just who I might have been
I do not recognize the vessel
But the eyes seem so familiar
Like phosphorescent desert buttons
Singing one familiar song

[Chorus]
So good to see you
I've missed you so much
So glad it's over
I've missed you so much
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?
Came out to watch you play
Why are you running away?

I opened my eye and there we were
I opened my eye, I opened my eye
I opened my eye and there we were

I met a boy wearing Vans, 501s
And a dope Beastie tee, nipple rings, new tattoos
That claimed that he was OGT
Back from '92, from the first EP
And in between sips of Coke
He told me that he thought we were sellin' out
Layin' down, suckin' up to the man

Well now, I've got some advice for you, little buddy
Before you point your finger, you should know that I'm the man
I'm the man and you're the man and he's the man as well
So you can point that fuckin' finger up your ass

I sold my soul to make a record, dipshit

Here from the wild dream come true

If I thought I'd lose you just one day

In love with the dark side I'd found
Dabblin' all the way down
Up to my neck, soon to drown
But you changed that all for me
Lifted me up, turned me 'round

So I, I, I, I
I would, I would, I would wish this all away

Prayed like a martyr dusk to dawn
Begged like a hooker all night long
Tempted the devil with my song
And got what I wanted all along

But I, I would
If I could, then I would
Wish it away, wish it away
Wish it all away
Wanna wish it all away
No prize that could hold sway
Or justify my giving away my center

So if I could I'd wish it all away
If I thought tomorrow would take you away
You, my peace of mind, my all, my center
Just tryin' to hold on one more day
Damn my eyes, damn my eyes
Damn my eyes if they should compromise the fulcrum
If wants and needs divide me, then I might as well be gone

He had a lot of nothing to say
We'll miss him
We'll miss him
We are gonna miss him
We are gonna miss him

So long
We wish you well
You told us how you weren't afraid to die
Well, so long
Don't cry here
Or feel too down
Not all martyrs see divinity
But at least you tried

Standing above the crowd
He had a voice that was strong and loud
We'll miss him
We'll miss him

Ranting and pointing his finger
At everything but his heart
We'll miss him
We'll miss him
We are gonna miss him
We are gonna miss him

Yeah, no way, yeah, to recall
What it was that you had said to me
Like I care at all
But it was so loud
And you sure could yell
You took a stand on every little thing
And it was so loud

You could be the one who saves me from my own existence
Warn while some child might chill, nine-one-two

I'm too smart when you're invisible by the bone symbol on you. So he bashes his skull through the window while looking out to the sea. Like torment of my ego. And we're amused by this

Yeah, standing above the crowd
He had a voice that was strong and loud and I
Swallowed his facade because I'm so
Eager to identify with
Someone above the ground
Someone who seemed to feel the same
Someone prepared to lead the way, and
Someone who would die for me

Will you? Will you now?
Would you die for me?
Don't you fucking lie

Don't you step out of line
Don't you step out of line
Don't you step out of line
Don't you fucking lie

You've claimed all this time that you would die for me
Why then are you so surprised when you hear your own
Eulogy?

I saw the gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Take care not to make me enter
If I do, we both may disappear

Know that I will choke until I swallow
Choke this infant here before me
What is this but my reflection?
Who am I to judge or strike you down?

But you're
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me
Pushing and shoving me

But you didn't need to push it on me

Rest your trigger on my finger
Bang my head upon the fault line
You better take care not to make me enter

I'm alive when you're touching me
Alive when you're shoving me down, yeah
But I'd trade it all
For just a little peace of mind

Push it on me, push it on me
Push it on me, push it on me
You're pushing, and shoving, and scrambling
To keep my feet flat on the ground

Push me somewhere I don't wanna be
You put me somewhere I don't wanna be
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see
Never want to see that place again

Saw that gap again today
While you were begging me to stay
Managed to push myself away
And you, as well, my dear
And if when I say I might fade like a sigh if I stay
You minimize my movement anyway
I must persuade you another way

I have come curiously close to the end, though
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole
Defeated

I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me (Calling me)
It's calling me (Calling me)

[Verse 2]
And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret, a confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me
The source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting
And as I pull my head out, I am without one doubt
Don't want to be down here soothing my narcissism, I
Must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out

[Refrain]
Before I pine away (Pine away)
Before I pine away (Pine away)
Before I pine away (Pine away)

[Verse 3]
So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable
So let the light touch you so that the words spill through
And let the past break through, bringing out our hope and reason

The face of your own stability
Suddenly look away
Leaving you with the dead and hopeless?
Eleven and she was gone
Eleven is when we waved goodbye
Eleven is standing still (Waiting for me)
Waiting for me to free him by
Coming home

Moving me with a sound
Opening me within a gesture
Drawing me down and in

Showing me where it all began
Eleven
He was too scarred to realize
You were the voice that's been calling me back home

Under a dead Ohio sky
Eleven has been and will be waiting
Defending his light and wondering
Where the hell have I been?
Sleeping lost and numb, I'm
So glad that I have found you
I am wide awake and heading home

I wish that I could see you
Turn and run to play
Dreams are fading
Carry my ancient soul
Carry me into the light
Aim your body heavenly
Enduring a memory
I'll come to your light
Hold your light where I can see it
High

Hold your light, Eleven
Lead me through each gentle step, by step
By inch by loaded memory, I'll move to heal
As soon as pain allows so we can
Reunite and both move on together
Hold your light, Eleven
Lead me through each gentle step, by step
By inch by loaded memory until
One and one are one, eleven

And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber, and took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself.

And terror possessed me then. And I begged, ""Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?""
And the angel said unto me, ""These are the cries of the carrots. The cries of the carrots. You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust"". And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared, ""Hear me now, I have seen the light!

It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch. You looked up at your sky. Then, that made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too. When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes. Your hands were sticky. You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green. Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this? You were already getting nervous again. Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up. Your head was almost empty. It always hurt you when you woke up like this. You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk, waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you. You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it. ""If God is our father,"" you thought, ""then Satan must be our cousin."" Why didn't anyone else understand these important things? You got to your car and tried all the doors. They were locked. It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color, and of course, those little people out there were yours too",Tool,Metal

Um, okay, I'm a former employee of Area 51
I, I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago and, and...
I've kind of been running across the country
Damn, I don't know where to start, they are
They are going to, um, they'll triangulate on this position really soon
Okay, um, um, okay
What we're thinking of as, as aliens
They are extra-dimensional beings
That, an earlier precursor of the, um, space program they made contact with
They are not what they claim to be
Uh, they've infiltrated a, a lot of aspects of, of, of the military establishment
Particularly the Area 51
The disasters that are coming, they, the military
I'm sorry, the government knows about them
And there's a lot of safe areas in this world that they could begin moving

Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your arms between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

[Chorus 1]
Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up

[Verse 2]
Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging 'till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem

An' a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger

An' when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind

An' her lips are like the galaxy's edge
An' her kiss the colour of a constellation

I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

[Verse 2]
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)

So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

To do me no good

Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates

Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, ""Long Hot Summer""
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency

But it don't sound much like you, girl

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

[Bridge]
Under a spell, you're hypnotised (Ooh)
Darling, how could you be so blind? (Snap out of it)
Under a spell, you're hypnotised (Ooh)
Darling, how could you be so blind?

[Chorus]
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feelin' I left it too late, but, baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing
Or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
I'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
12,Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino,"[Verse 1]
Jesus in the day spa, filling out the information form
Mama got her hair done, just popping out to sing a protest song
I've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
Where I ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Verse 2]
This magical thinking feels as if it really might catch on
Mama wants some answers
Do you remember where it all went wrong?
Technological advances really bloody get me in the mood
Pull me in close on a crisp eve, baby
Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

[Chorus]
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Bridge]
And do you celebrate your dark side
Then wish you'd never left the house?
Have you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?

Hoo
Good afternoon

13,Suck It and See,"[Verse 1]
Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss, it could put creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just post-mix lemonade

[Chorus]
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you

[Verse 2]
I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

[Chorus]
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for

[Bridge]
Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
""Baby, I was made to break your heart"", oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go, go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
14,Cornerstone,"[Verse 1]
I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

[Verse 2]
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
""Please, can I call you her name?""

[Chorus]
And I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Verse 3]
I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
""No, you can't call me her name""

[Bridge]
Tell me, where's your hiding place?
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

[Chorus]
I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Verse 4]
I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
She was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
She said, ""I'm really not supposed to, but yes
You can call me anything you want""",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
15,One for the Road,"[Intro]
One for the road, oooh oooh
One for the road, oooh oooh

[Verse 1]
From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

[Chorus]
One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

[Verse 2]
I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

[Chorus]
One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

[Bridge]
The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling
Don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road

[Guitar Solo]
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh

One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
16,Crying Lightning,"[Verse 1]
Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons

[Verse 2]
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

[Chorus]
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying Lightning

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
17,Mardy Bum,"[Verse 1]
Well, now then, mardy bum
I've seen your frown and it's like looking down
The barrel of a gun, and it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer

[Chorus]
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Ah, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Verse 2]
Well, now then mardy bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

[Chorus]
Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Ah, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Bridge]
And yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train and then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs
Oh, when you say I don't care
But, of course I do, yeah, I clearly do

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Oh, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
18,One Point Perspective,"[Verse 1]
Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band anorl (Stop)
Back there by the baby grand
Did Mr. Winter Wonderland
Say, ""Come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk""?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

[Verse 2]
I fantasise, I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood (Stop)

[Bridge]
Oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singer must die

[Verse 3]
""Singsong 'Round the Money Tree""
This stunning documentary
That no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography
It's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
19,Fireside,"[Verse 1]
I can't explain but I wanna try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by
In the morning and in the night time
There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

[Verse 2]
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
But something about it's changed

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?

[Bridge]
And I thought I was yours forever
Or maybe I was mistaken
But I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind

20,When the Sun Goes Down,"[Intro]
I said, who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 1]
Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
""I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down""
And oh, he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here

[Verse 2]
Look, here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mr. Inconspicuous?
And he don't even have to say owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up
Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
It don't stop in the winter, no

[Chorus]
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river, going out of town
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here, oh

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance, I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
21,I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor,"[Verse 1]
Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
What it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to

[Pre-Chorus]
And your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

[Chorus]
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984

[Verse 2]
I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because it's sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair

[Pre-Chorus]
That your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

[Chorus]
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984

[Bridge]
And no, there in't no love
No Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets and
Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness

[Chorus]
Well, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor

Said, from 1984",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
22,Teddy Picker,"[Verse 1]
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
Plenty of desperation to be seen
Staring at the television screen
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
Well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the Top 100 list

[Chorus 1]
And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were dying for it

[Verse 2]
She saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
That says that ""We are defenders of any poser
Or professional pretender around""

[Chorus 2]
And when did your list replace the twist and turn
Like a fist replaced a kiss?
Don't concern us with your bollocks, I don't want your prayer
Save it for the morning after

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 1]
And it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
Don't be surprised when you get bent over
They told you, but you were gagging for it

Let's have a game on the teddy picker
Not quick enough, can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker

23,The Ultracheese,"[Verse 1]
Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
And didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event

[Verse 2]
What a death I died writing that song
Start to finish, with you looking on
It stays between us, Steinway, and his sons
'Cause it's the ultracheese
Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
Dressed like a fictional character
From a place they called America in the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just tryna orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone
Because you had the chance

[Verse 3]
I've still got pictures of friends on the wall
I might look as if I'm deep in thought
But the truth is I'm probably not
If I ever was

Oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
I've done some things that I shouldn't have done
But I haven't stopped loving you once",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
24,Do Me a Favour,"[Verse 1]
Well, the mourning was complete
When there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
Several hours or several weeks
I'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak

[Verse 2]
It's the beginning of the end
The car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
Ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
To start to break in half, to start to fall apart, hold on to your heart

[Chorus]
And do me a favour and break my nose
Or do me a favour and tell me to go away
Or do me a favour and stop asking questions

[Verse 3]
As she walked away, well, her shoes were untied
And the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd cried
And I watched and I waited till she was inside
Forcing a smile and waving goodbye
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
Curiosity becomes a heavy load
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold

[Chorus]
Do me a favour and ask if you need some help
She said, ""Do me a favour and stop flattering yourself""
And to tear apart the ties that bind
Perhaps ""fuck off"" might be too kind
Perhaps ""fuck off"" might be too kind",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
25,Stop the World I Wanna Get Off With You,"[Verse 1]
Open Sesame (We've places to go)
We've people to see (Let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes that I bet you can make
When you want to escape, say the word

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you, I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you

[Chorus]
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you

[Verse 2]
Eyes the colour of (Water left in mud)
Icing sugar dust (Crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?

Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie, and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both oughta put 'em on hold and I know you agree

Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off with you",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
26,Only Ones Who Know,"[Verse 1]
In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealing
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

[Chorus]
And even if somehow we could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own

[Verse 2]
And I bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises, they don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

[Chorus]
And even if somehow they could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own
You are the only ones who know",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
27,Brianstorm,"[Verse 1]
Brian, top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder, are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator

[Verse 2]
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours
She'll be saying, ""Use me, show me the jacuzzi""
I imagine that it's there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while
I doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
The eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm

[Verse 3]
(Brian) Calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying) You leave the other story standing
With your renditions and jokes, bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
Are you putting us under?
'Cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
Well, see you later, innovator",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
28,Love Is a Laserquest,"[Verse 1]
Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or darling, have you started feeling old yet?
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe

[Chorus]
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest
I pretend that you were just some lover

[Verse 2]
Now I can't think of there without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide

[Chorus]
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute, it gets easier
To pretend that you were just some lover

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about summer
Will I have found a better method of
Pretending you were just some lover?
Will I have found a better method of
Pretending you were just some lover?",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
29,A Certain Romance,"[Spoken Intro]
""Shall I keep rolling?""

[Verse 1]
Well, oh, they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse, or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there in't no romance around there
And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see 'em then you would agree
Agree that there in't no romance around there

[Chorus]
You know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

[Verse 2]
'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music so that there's new ringtones
And it dun't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here
Don't get me wrong though, there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

[Chorus]
Don't you know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

[Bridge]
But I said no, oh no
Well, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go
Oh, no, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
But over there, there's friends of mine
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
And they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No, not in the same way
Said, not in the same way
Oh no, oh no, no",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
30,Batphone,"[Verse 1]
I want an interesting synonym
To describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine
(We've got much to discuss)
Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams

[Verse 2]
It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

[Chorus 1]
I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get ahold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

[Verse 3]
You go in through the door
Vengeance Trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

[Chorus 2]
I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by, but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Killer Pink Flamingos, computer controlled
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
31,I Want It All,"[Verse 1]
Blind faith, heartache
Mind games, mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole

[Chorus]
I want it all
I want it all

[Verse 2]
Old dogs, new tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle

[Chorus]
I want it all
I want it all

[Verse 3]
And then suddenly it hit me, it’s a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your Coke
Said, ain’t it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road?
Leave me listening to the Stones, 2000 Light Years From Home

32,American Sports,"[Verse 1]
So when you gaze at planet Earth from outer space
Does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
I saw this aura over the battleground states
I lost the money, lost the keys
But I'm still handcuffed to the briefcase

[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lolas
Can I please have my money back?
My virtual reality mask is stuck on Parliament Brawl
Emergency battery pack, just in time for my weekly chat
With God on videocall

[Verse 2]
Breaking news, they take the truth and make it fluid
The trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
A montage of the latest ancient ruins
Soundtracked by a chorus of ""You don't know what you're doing""

[Chorus]
And I never thought, not in a million years
That I'd meet so many Lolas

[Bridge]
And all of my most muscular regrets
Explode behind my eyes like American sports
Hoo

And I never thought, not in a million year
That I'd meet so many Lolas",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
33,Old Yellow Bricks,"[Verse 1]
Old yellow bricks, love's a risk
Quite the little escapologist
Looked so miffed when you wished
For a thousand places better than this
You are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

[Chorus]
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

[Verse 2]
She was enraged by the way
That the emperor were trapped in the cage
And the days she deemed dull
Leading to nights reading beer bottles
You're such a fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
You can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from

[Chorus]
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?

[Verse 3]
You're at a loss just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was
You are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running away from
She said, ""I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia""
I know I said, ""Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?""
But Dorothy was right though",Arctic Monkeys,Indie
34,Piledriver Waltz,"[Verse 1]
I etched the face of a stopwatch on the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass
I heard an unhappy ending, it sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning

[Chorus]
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
And the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

[Verse 2]
Mysteries flashing amber go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire never changes
I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning

[Chorus]
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
And the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

Every whimsical thought that enters my mind
There's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

(She looks like fun) Dogsitting
(She looks like fun) Screwballing

Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
Baby, but why can't we all just get along?
Dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are

No one's on the streets
We moved it all online as of March
I'm so full of shite
I need to spend less time stood around in bars
Waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
And how much I respect them

36,From the Ritz to the Rubble,"[Verse 1]
Well, last night these two bouncers
And one of 'em's alright, the other one's a scary'un
His way or no way; totalitarian
He's got no time for you looking or breathing
How he don’t want you to, so step out the queue
He makes examples of you, and there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think they want you all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
I said a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

[Verse 2]
Well, this town's a different town today
Said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
And that girl's a different girl today
Said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday
Of course not

Well, I'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
I thought a thousand million things that I could never think this morning
Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

Last night, what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore

Mad sounds, in your ears
Make you feel alright

Love buckles under the strain
Of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide

Mad sounds, in your ears

All night long they reappear

We just weren't feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes
But you just can’t figure out what went wrong

Last night when my psyche's
Subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice
You slowly dropped your eyelids
When true love takes a grip, it leaves you without a choice

[Chorus]
And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too

The leader of the free world
Reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
He's got him sen a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too

Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment, but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah
Regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
Of course it's fancy dress
And they're all looking quite full on
In bunny ears and devil horns and how

Fake tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom
And there's a super cool band, yeah
With their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
Practicing their lines

I don't want to hear you (Kick me out, kick me out)

And there's a few bored faces at the back, all
Wishing they weren't there
And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps

Oh, she's running to the streets outside
""Oh, you've saved me,"" she screams down the line
""The band were fucking wank and I'm not having a nice time""

I don't want to hear you, no (Kick me out, kick me out)

Religious iconography giving you the creeps?
I feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek
The rise of the machines
I must admit you gave me something momentarily
In which I could believe
But the hand of harsh reality's un-gloved
And it's on its way back here to scoop you up
But not on my watch

[Chorus]
I want to stay with you, my love
The way some science fiction does

[Verse 2]
Reflections in the silver screen of strange societies
Swamp monster with a hard-on for connectivity
The ascension of the C.R.E.A.M
Mass panic on a not too distant future colony
Quantitative easing
I want to make a simple point about peace and love
But in a sexy way where it's not obvious
Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages

In my little mirror, mirror on the wall

Running off over next door's garden before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone?
Or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish where you wish you'd never been born?
You tie yourself to the tracks and there isn't no going back
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

[Verse 2]
Are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks?
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but she can hardly wait

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn

Of the day of the most flawless heist of all time

You knew that it'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
Quiet and unassuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off but you resisted and fought

If you can summon the strength, tow me

Trudging through the morning
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm
Shifts past your whiskers, so stark is the charm
But the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned
And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round
In your muddy mind, blatantly caked and
Unwilling to wind uncooperative time
So he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry

And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the

What came first, the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk
Your legs start running and your head gets caught
Canopy 19 is perfectly placed
For the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away, I am unhappy to say
Behold as the crook in the hammock plays

Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

And fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

46,No Buses,"[Verse 1]
Lady, where has your love gone?
I was looking but can't find it anywhere
They always offer when there's loads of love around
But when you're short of some, it's nowhere to be found
Well, I know your game, you told him yesterday
""No chance, you'll get nothing from me""
But now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
He's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be, just like me

Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she, you think she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four
And just 'cause everybody's doing it
Does that mean that I can too?

Lady, where has your love gone?
It was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand
Must you first be in demand?
How he longs for you to long for him once more
Just once more

Let's go down, down, low down
Where I know I should not go
Oh, and she, you think she's the one
But she's just one in twenty-four

Oh, her eyes went down and cut you up
And there's nothing like a dirty look from
The one you want or the one you've lost

To get what they can't have

Lying on her front, up against the wall

Fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

[Verse 1]
She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here
It's a magnolia celebration to be attended on a Wednesday night
It's better that than get a reputation as a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion she came to in this overture

[Bridge]
And the secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along

[Verse 2]
Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
Then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
I'm unveiling the unexpected
I, who was earlier reluctant
Was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature survive in such a habitat?

[Bridge]
And the secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along
Even if they were to find us
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied

[Chorus]
As all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
Ones you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence
But you're daft to think she'd care

But I want you hard

You're so dark
You're so dark

And you're so mysterious
Got that obsession with death
I saw you driving your Prius
And even that was Munster Koach-esque
You watch Italian horror
And you listen to the scores
Leather-cladded, spike collared
I want you down on all fours

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

[Bridge]
I know you're nothing like mine
'Cause she's walking on sunshine
And your love would tear us apart
And I know I'm not your type
'Cause I don't shun the daylight
But, baby, I'm willing to start

You're so dark

Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather
And what's a man to do but work out whether it's true?
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper
Who can open up a map and see between one and two

Time to get it
Before you let it get to you
Here he comes now
Stick to your guns and let him through

Everybody's coming from the winter vacation
Taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes
With Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue

Ah, here it comes
I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station
Gonna fight and tear it up in a hypernation for you

Now I see it
I think I'll leave it out of the way
Now I come near you
And it's not clear while you make the way

[Verse 4]
Looking for a ride to your secret location
Where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation for you
Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rockin'
And a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now

It better work out
I hope it works out my way
Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city's head
It takes a teenage riot to get me out of bed right now

We paint a zero on his hand

A one man showdown teach us how to fail

2,Schizophrenia,"I went away to see an old friend of mine
His sister came over, she was out of her mind
She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin
She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm in
Her light eyes were dancing, she is insane
Her brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chain
She keeps coming closer saying, ""I can feel it in my bones
Schizophrenia is taking me home.""

It's already had it
I could tuck you in
And we can talk about it
I had a dream
And it split the scene
But I got a hunch
It's coming back to me",Sonic Youth,Indie

I wonder how he's gonna make it back

And now I hope you'll understand
You reflected into his looking glass soul
Now the mirror is your only friend

Sail into the heart of the lonely storm
And tell her that you'll love her eternally

24,Hey Joni,"[Chorus]
Hey Joni, put it all behind you
Hey Joni, now I've put it all behind me too
These times can't add up, your life's such a mess
Forget the past and just say yes

[Verse 1]
Tell me Joni, am I the one to see you through?
In this broken town, can you still jack in and know what to do?
I remember our youth, our high ideals
I remember you were so uptight
That time in the trees, we broke that vice
We took some steps and now we can't think twice

[Verse 2]
Tell me Joni, am I right by you?
Tell me how you're gonna lose this hard luck
Hey Joni, when will all these dreams come true?
You'd better find a way to climb down off that truck

[Verse 3]
Shots ring out from the center of an empty field
Joni's in the tall grass
She's a beautiful mental jukebox
A sailboat explosion
A snap of electric whip crack
She's not thinking about the future
She's not spinning her wheels
She doesn't think at all about the past
She's thinking long and hard about that wild sound
And wondering, will it last?

Kick it!

[Bridge]
Hey Joni, put it all behind you
There's something turning, it's turning right to you
My head burns, but I know you speak the truth, hey!

[Chorus]
Hey Joni, put it all behind you
Hey Joni, now I've put it all behind me too
Forget the future, these times are such a mess
Tune out the past and just say yes

Coming on to me, like a silver eye
Pick it up and turn it on and
Head on out to a western star land

Pulling a trigger like breathing air

0,Be Safe,"""One of those fucking awful black days
When nothing is pleasing and everything that happens
Is an excuse for anger
An outlet for emotions stockpiled. An arsenal. An armour

These are the days when I hate the world
Hate the rich, hate the happy
Hate the complacent - the TV watchers
The beer drinkers, the satisfied ones
Because I know I can be all of those little hateful things
And then I hate myself for realizing that
There's no preventative, directive or safe approach to living
We each know our own fate
We know from our youth how to be treated
How we'll be received, how we shall end
These things don't change
You can change yr clothes
Change yr hairstyle, yr friends, cities, continents...
But sooner or later yr own self will always catch up
Always it waits in the wings

(Ideas swirl but don't stick
They appear but then run off like rain on the windshield)

One of those rainy day car rides, my head imploding
The atmosphere in this car a mirror of my skull:
Wet, damp, windows dripping and misted with cold
Walls of gray
Nothing good on the radio, not a thought in my head""

I know a place we can go
Where you'll fall in love so hard that
You'll wish you were dead

""Let's take life and slow it down incredibly slow
Frame by frame
The two minutes that take ten years to live out
Yeah, let's do that
Telephone poles like praying mantis against the sky
Metal arms outstretched
So much land traveled, so little sense made of it
It doesn't mean a thing, all this land all laying out behind us
I'd like to take off into these woods and just get good and lost for a while
I'm disgusted with petty concerns
Parking tickets, breakfast specials
Does someone just have to carry this weight?

Methane covenant
Linear gospel

Like a snake eating its own tail
A steam turbine, frog pond
Too-full closets burst open in disarray
Soap bubbles in the sun
Hospital death bed, red convertible, shopping list
Blowjob, Deaths head
Devils dancing, bleached white buildings
Memory movements, the movie unpeeling, unreeling
About to begin.""

""I've seen yr hallway, you are a dark hallway
I've hear yr stairs creak
I can fix my mind on yr 'yes' and yr 'no'
I'll film yr face today in the sparkling canals
All red yellow blue green brilliance
And silvered Dutch reflections
Racing thoughts - racing thoughts, all too real
Yr moving so fast now I can't hold yr image -
This image I have of yr face by the window
Me standing beside you, arm on yr shoulder
A catalog of images, flashing glimpses, then gone again
I'm tethered to this post you've sunk in me
In every clear afternoon now I'll think of you, up in the air
Twisting yr heel, yr knees up around me, my face in yr hair
You scream so well
Yr smile so loud, it still rings in my ears.""

Open ALL the boxes
OPEN ALL the boxes

Times Square, midday, newspaper building, news headlines going around
We watch as they go (and hope for some good ones!)
Those tree-shadows in the park here
All whispering, shiksing leaves, around 6PM
Shadows across the cobblestones
Girl in front of bathroom mirror
She slow and careful paints her face green, mask-like
Like Matisse, ""Portrait with Green Stripe""
Long shot through apartment window
A monologue on top but no girl in shot

The light within me shines like a diamond mine
Like an unarmed walrus
Like a dead man face down on a highway
Like a snake eating its own tail
A steam turbine, frog pond
Too-full closets burst open in disarray
Soap bubbles in the sun

Only one night to try and change my life

And now there's nothing I can do

[Chorus]
So I try to laugh about it
Cover it all up with lies
I try to laugh about it
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

[Verse 3]
I would tell you that I loved you
If I thought that you would stay
But I know that it's no use
And you've already gone away

[Bridge]
Misjudged your limits
Pushed you too far
Took you for granted
I thought that you needed me more, more, more

[Chorus]
Now I would do 'most anything
To get you back by my side
But I just keep on laughing
Hiding the tears in my eyes
'Cause boys don't cry
Boys don't cry

[Outro]
Boys don't cry",The Cure,Indie
4,Pictures of You,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear

[Verse 3]
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

[Verse 4]
Remembering you fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

[Verse 5]
Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 6]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
And always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

[Outro]
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you",The Cure,Indie
5,Lullaby,"[Intro]
I spy
Something beginning with 'S'

[Verse 1]
On candy-stripe legs the Spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom
And suddenly a movement in the corner of the room
And there is nothing I can do when I realise with fright
That the Spiderman is having me for dinner tonight

[Verse 2]
Quietly he laughs and shaking his head
Creeps closer now, closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow and quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
Be still, be calm, be quiet now, my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The Spiderman is having you for dinner tonight

[Bridge]
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering, furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the Spiderman is always hungry

[Outro]
""Come into my parlor,"" said the spider to the fly
""I have a little something here""",The Cure,Indie
6,Disintegration,"[Verse 1]
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

[Verse 2]
I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece

[Chorus 1]
But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be

[Verse 3]
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over

[Bridge]
And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again

[Chorus 2]
But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity
Screaming it over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
And stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
And songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is

[Outro]
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always is
Always is",The Cure,Indie
7,Close to Me,"[Verse 1]
I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be
This close to me

[Verse 2]
Just try to see in the dark
Just try to make it work
To feel the fear before you're here
I make the shapes come much too close
I pull my eyes out, hold my breath and wait
Until I sha-ha-ha-hake

[Chorus]
But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream

[Verse 1]
I've waited hours for this
I've made myself so sick
I wish I'd stayed asleep today
I never thought this day would end
I never thought tonight could ever be
This close to me

[Chorus]
But if I had your faith
Then I could make it safe and clean
Oh, if only I was sure
That my head on the door was a dream",The Cure,Indie
8,In Between Days,"[Verse 1]
Yesterday I got so old, I felt like I could die
Yesterday I got so old, it made me want to cry
Go on, go on, just walk away
Go on, go on, your choice is made
Go on, go on and disappear
Go on, go on away from here

[Chorus]
And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her inbetween without you
Without you

[Verse 2]
Yesterday I got so scared, I shivered like a child
Yesterday, away from you, it froze me deep inside
Come back come back, don't walk away
Come back, come back, come back today
Come back, come back, why can't you see?
Come back, come back, come back to me

[Chorus]
And I know I was wrong when I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her in between without you
Without you
Without you, without you

[Outro]
Without you, without you
Without you, without you",The Cure,Indie
9,A Forest,"[Verse 1]
Come closer and see
See into the trees
Find the girl while you can
Come closer and see
See into the dark
Just follow your eyes
Just follow your eyes

[Verse 2]
I hear her voice
Calling my name
The sound is deep
In the dark
I hear her voice
And start to run
Into the trees
Into the trees

Into the trees

[Verse 3]
Suddenly I stop
But I know it's too late
I'm lost in a forest
All alone
The girl was never there
It's always the same
I'm running towards nothing
Again and again and again and again",The Cure,Indie
10,Plainsong,"I think it's dark and it looks like it's rain, you said
And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world, you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And then you smiled for a second

I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain, you said
And it's all running out like it's the end of the world, you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And then you smiled for a second

Sometimes you make me feel
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
It's just the way I smile, you said",The Cure,Indie
11,Fascination Street,"[Verse 1]
Oh, it's opening time down on Fascination Street
So let's cut the conversation and get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading and paling, and I'm begging
To drag you down with me to kick the last nail in

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I like you in that like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth, then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout

[Verse 3]
And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
If you slip going under, slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street

[Verse 4]
So pull on your hair, pull on your pout
Cut the conversation, just open your mouth
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time down on Fascination Street

12,The Lovecats,"[Verse 1]
We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk, the way we talk
The way we stalk, the way we kiss

We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker, and wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw all the songs we know

[Chorus]
Into the sea, you and me
All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully, wonderfully
Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea, huh?
We should have each other with cream?

Then curl up in the fire
And sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream

Into the sea, you and me
All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats

We're so wonderfully, wonderfully
Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to dinner, huh?
We should have each other with cream?

Then curl up in the fire
Get up for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream

[Verse 2]
Hand in hand is the only way to land
And always the right way round
Not broken in pieces, like hated little meeces
How could we miss someone as dumb as this?

[Outro]
I love you, let's go
Oh, solid gold
How could we miss
Someone as dumb as this?",The Cure,Indie
13,A Letter to Elise,"[Chorus]
Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

[Verse]
Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would, if they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing
Something else that hides away
From me and you, there are worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh, I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I'll throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do
Elise, believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out

[Chorus]
So, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

[Outro]
And every time I try to pick it up
Like falling sand
As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands
But there's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do
There's nothing else I can really do
At all",The Cure,Indie
14,One Hundred Years,"[Verse 1]
It doesn't matter if we all die
Ambition in the back of a black car
In a high building there is so much to do
Going home time, a story on the radio

[Verse 2]
Something small falls out of your mouth and we laugh
A prayer for something better
A prayer for something better
Please love me
Meet my mother, but the fear takes hold
Creeping up the stairs in the dark
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow
Waiting for the death blow

[Verse 3]
Stroking your hair as the patriots are shot
Fighting for freedom on the television
Sharing the world with slaughtered pigs
Have we got everything?,
She struggles to get away
The pain and the creeping feeling, a little black haired girl
Waiting for Saturday, the death of her father pushing her
Pushing her white face into the mirror
Aching inside me and turn me 'round
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days
Just like the old days

[Verse 4]
Caressing an old man and painting a lifeless face
Just a piece of new meat in a clean room
The soldiers close in under a yellow moon
All shadows and deliverance under a black flag
A hundred years of blood, crimson
The ribbon tightens round my throat
I open my mouth and my head bursts open
A sound like a tiger thrashing in the water
Thrashing in the water
Over and over, we die one after the other
Over and over, we die one after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other
One after the other

It feels like a hundred years
A hundred years

Before we finally [?] BBC 2 today [?] A reminder that there's a treat in store for opera lovers [?] tomorrow evening with a sparkling performance from the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden of one of the world's best-loved Romantic operas] Puccini at 5-past-8 tomorrow. Well now there's the last look at the clock this eve, and the time's just winding its way round to eight minutes to one. If you're still up and about and want a bit more entertainment, a reminder that our colleagues over at BBC Radio are still on the airwaves.

But for now, on behalf of everyone here on BBC 2, this is Robin Whitting-

[Sample 2]
Yeah, a green sedan. No, the licence plates were covered with mud. They took tyres and gas. (Tell him they took all the cash.) They robbed the cash register too. I got word that the police had them bottled up... but they slipped through again. (I wonder if the baby is born yet.) Poor Joan. They're being blamed for every crime committed in the country

[Sample 3]
[Incomprehensible]

[Verse 1]
A hand in my mouth
A life spills into the flowers
We all look so perfect
As we all fall down
In an electric glare
The old man cracks with age
She found his last picture
In the ashes of the fire

[Verse 2]
An image of the queen
Echoes round the sweating bed
Sour yellow sounds inside my head
In books
And films
And in life
And in heaven
The sound of slaughter
As your body turns...

But it's too late
But it's too late

One more day like today and I'll kill you
A desire for flesh
And real blood
And I'll watch you drown in the shower
Pushing my life through your open eyes...

16,The Same Deep Water as You,"[Verse 1]
Kiss me goodbye, pushing out before I sleep
Can't you see I try?
But swimming the same deep water as you is hard
'The shallow drowned lose less than we,' you breathe
The strangest twist upon your lips
And we shall be together
And we shall be together

[Verse 2]
Kiss me goodbye, bow your head, and join with me
And face pushed deep, reflections meet
The strangest twist upon your lips
And disappear, the ripples clear
And softly breaks against your feet
Softly breaks the mirror sweet
So we shall be together
So we shall be together

[Verse 3]
Kiss me goodbye, pushing out before I sleep
It's lower now, and slower now
The strangest twist upon your lips
But I don't see, and I don't feel
But softly hold up silently
My hands, before my fading eyes
And in my eyes your smile
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go

I will kiss you, I will kiss you
I will kiss you forever on nights like this
I will kiss you, I will kiss you
And we shall be together",The Cure,Indie

Standing on the beach
With a gun in my hand
Staring at the sky
Staring at the sand
Staring down the barrel
At the arab on the ground
I can see his open mouth
But I hear no sound

[Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab

[Verse 2]
I can turn
And walk away
Or I can fire the gun
Staring at the sky
Staring at the sun
Whichever I chose
It amounts to the same
Absolutely nothing

[Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger
Killing an arab

[Verse 3]
I feel the steel butt jump
Smooth in my hand
Staring at the sea
Staring at the sand
Staring at myself
Reflected in the eyes
Of the dead man on the beach
(The dead man on the beach)

[Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm dead
I'm the stranger

18,Burn,"[Verse 1]
'Don't look, don't look,' the shadows breathe
Whispering me away from you
'Don't wake at night to watch her sleep
You know that you will always lose
This trembling, adored
Tousled birdmad girl'

[Chorus 1]
But every night I burn
Every night I call your name
Every night I burn
Every night I fall again

[Veerse 2]
'Oh, don't talk of love' the shadows purr
Murmuring me away from you
'Don't talk of worlds that never were
The end is all that's ever true
There's nothing you can ever say
Nothing you can ever do'

[Chorus 2]
Still every night I burn
Every night I scream your name
Every night I burn
Every night the dream's the same
Every night I burn
Waiting for my only friend
Every night I burn
Waiting for the world to end

Find you if we're wanting to
So slide back down and close your eyes
Sleep a while, you must be tired...'

19,Closedown,"[Verse]
I'm running out of time
I'm out of step and closing down
And never sleep for wanting hours

And uselessly always the need
To feel again the real belief
Of something more than mockery
If only I could fill my heart with love",The Cure,Indie
20,Untitled,"[Verse 1]
Hopelessly adrift in the eyes of the ghost again
Down on my knees and my hands in the air again
Pushing my face in the memory of you again
But I never know if it's real
Never know how I wanted to feel
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable
And now the time has gone
Another time undone

[Verse 2]
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable
And now the time has gone
Another time undone
Hopelessly fighting the devil futility
Feeling the monster climb deeper inside of me
Feeling him gnawing my heart away hungrily
I'll never lose this pain
Never dream of you again",The Cure,Indie
21,Last Dance,"[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
Expectantly, too punctual, but prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But older than me now, more constant, more real
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
To hair and contentment that hangs in abasement
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
Walking through walls in the heart of December
The blindness, the happiness, falling down laughing
But I really believed that this time was forever
But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
All this in an instant before I can kiss you
A woman now standing where once there was only a girl

[Quietly]
Your name like ice into my heart

[Verse 3]
I'm so glad you came, I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending our last dance together
Reluctantly, cautiously, but prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But Christmas falls late now, flatter and colder
And never as bright as when we used to fall
And even if we drink, I don't think we will kiss
In the way that we did when the woman was only a girl",The Cure,Indie
22,A Night Like This,"[Verse 1]
Say goodbye on a night like this
If it's the last thing we ever do
You never looked as lost as this
Sometimes it doesn't even look like you
It goes dark
It goes darker still
Please stay
But I watch you like I'm made of stone
As you walk away

[Chorus 1]
I'm coming to find you if it takes me all night
A witch hunt for another girl
For always and ever is always for you
Your trust
The most gorgeously stupid thing I ever cut in the world

[Verse 2]
Say hello on a day like today
Say it every time you move
The way that you look at me now
Makes me wish I was you
It goes deep
It goes deeper still
This touch
And the smile and the shake of your head
And the smile and the shake of your head

[Chorus 2]
I’m coming to find you if it takes me all night
Can’t stand here like this anymore
For always and ever is always for you
I want it to be perfect like before

Oh ho ho, I want to change it all
Oh ho ho, I want to change

23,Prayers for Rain,"[Verse 1]
You shatter me, your grip on me
A hold on me so dull it kills
You stifle me, infectious sense
Of hopelessness and prayers for rain

[Verse 2]
I suffocate, I breathe in dirt
And nowhere shines but desolate and drab
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain

[Chorus]
You fracture me, your hands on me
A touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me, entangle me
In hopelessness and prayers for rain

I deteriorate, I live in dirt
And nowhere glows but drearily and tired
The hours all spent on killing time again
All waiting for the rain

You fracture me, your hands on me
A touch so plain, so stale it kills
You strangle me, entangle me
In hopelessness and prayers for rain

You can't even see now
So you ask me the way
You wonder if it's real
Because it couldn't be rain
Through the right doorway
And into the white room
It used to be the dust that would lay here
When I came here alone

But I don't care if you don't
And I don't feel if you don't
And I don't want it if you don't
And I won't say it

You're so gorgeous I'll do anything
I'll kiss you from your feet to where your head begins
You're so perfect, you're so right as rain
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry again

Everything you do is irresistible
Everything you do is simply kissable
Why can't I be you?

I'll run around in circles until I run out of breath
I'll eat you all up or I'll just hug you to death
You're so wonderful, too good to be true
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry for you

[Chorus]
Everything you do is simply delicate
Everything you do is quite angelicate
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?

[Verse 3]
You turn my head when you turn around
You turn the whole world upside down
I'm smitten, I'm bitten, I'm hooked, I'm cooked, I'm stuck like glue
You make me, make me, make me, make me hungry for you

[Chorus]
Everything you do is simply dreamy
Everything you do is quite delicious
So why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
Why can't I be you?
You're simply elegant",The Cure,Indie
27,Siamese Twins,"[Verse 1]
I chose an eternity of this
Like falling angels, the world disappeared
Laughing into the fire, is it always like this?
Flesh and blood and the first kiss
The first colours, the first kiss

[Verse 2]
We writhed under a red light
Voodoo smile, Siamese twins
Girl at the window looks at me for an hour
Then everything falls apart
Broken inside me, it falls apart

[Chorus 1]
The walls and the ceiling move in time
Push a blade into my hands, slowly up the stairs
And into the room, is it always like this?

[Verse 3]
Dancing in my pocket
Worms eat my skin
She glows and grows with arms outstretched
Her legs around me, in the morning I cried

[Verse 4]
Leave me to die, you won't remember my voice
I walked away and grew old
You never talk, we never smile
I scream ""you're nothing
I don't need you any more, you're nothing""

[Chorus 2]
It fades and spins
Fades and spins
Sing out loud, we all die
Laughing into the fire, is it always like this?

[Outro]
Is it always like this?
Is it always like this?",The Cure,Indie
28,Homesick,"[Instrumental Intro 0:00 - 3:16]

[Intro]
Hey hey!

[Chorus 1]
Just one more
And I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today

[Verse 1]
And I forget how to move
When my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts
In a blood-stained sky
Oh it was sweet
It was wild
And oh how we...
I trembled
Stuck in honey
Honey
Cling to me...

[Chorus 2]
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home

Doodoodoodoo
Doodoodoodoo

[Chorus 1]
Oh just one more
And I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today

[Chorus 2]
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home

29,The Figurehead,"[Verse 1]
Sharp and open, leave me alone
And sleeping less every night
As the days become heavier and weighted
Waiting in the cold light
A noise, a scream tears my clothes as the figurines tighten
With spiders inside them
And dust on the lips of a vision of hell
I laughed in the mirror for the first time in a year

[Verse 2]
A hundred other words blind me with your purity
Like an old painted doll in the throes of dance
I think about tomorrow, please let me sleep
As I slip down the window, freshly squashed fly

[Refrain]
You mean nothing
You mean nothing

[Verse 3]
I can lose myself in Chinese art and American girls
All the time, lose me in the dark, please do it right
Run into the night, I will lose myself tomorrow
Crimson pain, my heart explodes
My memory in a fire, and someone will listen
At least for a short while

[Bridge]
(I can never say no)
I can never say no to anyone but you

[Verse 4]
Too many secrets, too many lies
Writhing with hatred
Too many secrets, please make it good tonight
But the same image haunts me, in sequence, in despair of time

[Chorus]
I will never be clean again
I touched her eyes, pressed my stained face
I will never be clean again

[Outro]
Touched her eyes, press my stained face
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again
I will never be clean again",The Cure,Indie
30,How Beautiful You Are,"[Verse 1]
You want to know why I hate you?
Well, I'll try and explain
You remember that day in Paris
When we wandered through the rain
And promised to each other
That we'd always think the same
And dreamed that dream
To be two souls as one
And stopped just as the sun set
And waited for the night
Outside a glittering building
Of glittering glass and burning light
And in the road before us
Stood a weary greyish man
Who held a child upon his back
A small boy by the hand
The three of them were dressed in rags
And thinner than the air
And all six eyes stared fixedly on you

[Chorus]
The father's eyes said ""Beautiful! How beautiful you are!""
The boy's eyes said
""How beautiful! She shimmers like a star!""
The child's eyes uttered nothing
But a mute and utter joy
And filled my heart with shame for us
At the way we are
At the way we are

[Verse 2]
I turned to look at you
To read my thoughts upon your face
And gazed so deep into your eyes
So beautiful and strange
Until you spoke
And showed me understanding is a dream
""I hate these people staring
Make them go away from me!""

[Chorus]
The father's eyes said ""Beautiful!
How beautiful you are!""
The boy's eyes said
""How beautiful!
She glitters like a star!""
The child's eyes uttered nothing
But a quiet and utter joy
And stilled my heart with sadness
At the way we are
At the way we are
At the way we are

[Outro]
And this is why I hate you
And how I understand
That no-one ever knows or loves another",The Cure,Indie
31,Cold,"[Verse 1]
Scarred, your back was turned, curled like an embryo
Take another face, you will be kissed again
I was cold as l mouthed the words and crawled across the mirror
And wait, await the next breath

[Refrain]
Your name like ice into my heart

[Verse 2]
A shallow grave, a monument to the ruined age
Ice in my eyes and eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon, another past time

[Refrain]
Your name like ice into my heart

[Chorus]
Everything as cold as life (can no one save you?)
Everything as cold as silence (and you will never say a word)

32,From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea,"[Verse 1]
Every time we do this, I fall for her
Wave after wave after wave, it's all for her
""I know this can't be wrong"", I say
(And I'll lie to keep her happy)
As long as I know that you know
That today I belong right here with you
Right here with you

And so we watch the sun come up
From the edge of the deep green sea
And she listens like her head's on fire
Like she wants to believe in me
So I try put your hands in the sky
Surrender, remember
We'll be here forever
And we'll never say goodbye

I've never been so colorfully
See through head before
(I've never been) I've never been so
Wonderfully me you want some more
And all I want is to keep it like this
You and me alone, a secret kiss
And don't go home, don't go away
Don't let this end, please stay

Not just for today

""Never, never, never, never, never let me go"", she says
""Hold me like this for a hundred thousand million days""
But suddenly she slows and looks down at my breaking face
""Why do you cry? What did I say?""
""But it's just rain"", I smile brushing my tears away

[Chorus 1]
I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears, too many times
Too many years I've cried over you

[Verse 2]
How much more can we use it up?
Drink it dry? Take this drug?
Looking for something forever gone
But something we will always want

""Why, why, why are you letting me go?"" she says
""I feel you pulling back, I feel you changing shape""
And just as I'm breaking free, she hangs herself in front of me
Slips her dress like a flag to the floor
And hands in the sky, surrenders it all

[Chorus 2]
I wish I could just stop
I know another moment will break my heart
Too many tears, too many times
Too many years I've cried for you

[Outro]
It's always the same, wake up in the rain
Head in pain, hung in shame
A different name, same old game, love in vain
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
Away from home again",The Cure,Indie
33,Jumping Someone Else’s Train,"[Verse 1]
Don't say what you mean
You might spoil your face
If you walk in the crowd
You won't leave any trace
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train

[Chorus]
It won't take you long
To learn the new smile
You'll have to adapt
Or you'll be out of style
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train

[Bridge]
If you pick up on it quick
You can say you were there
Again and again and again
You're jumping someone else's train

[Verse 2]
It's the latest wave
That you've been craving for
The old ideal
Was getting such a bore
Now you're back in line
Going not quite quite as far
But in half the time
Everyone's happy
They're finally all the same
Cause everyone's jumping
Everybody else's train

[Chorus]
It won't take you long
To learn the new smile
You'll have to adapt
Or you'll be out of style
It's always the same
You're jumping someone else's train

34,Faith,"[Instrumental 0:00 -2:09]

[Verse 1]
Catch me if I fall, I'm losing hold
I can't just carry on this way
And every time I turn away
I lose another blind game
The idea of perfection holds me
Suddenly, I see you change
Everything at once the same
But the mountain never moves
Rape me like a child, christened in blood
Painted like an unknown saint
There's nothing left but hope
Your voice is dead and old and oh, always empty
Trust in me through closing years
Perfect moments wait
If only we could stay
Please say the right words
We cry like the stone white clown
And stand, lost forever in a happy crowd

[Chorus]
No one lifts their hands
No one lifts their eyes
Justified with empty words
The party just gets better and better

[Refrain]
I went away alone
With nothing left but faith
I went away alone
With nothing left but faith

[Outro]
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith, with nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith, with nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith
With nothing left but faith

35,High,"[Verse 1]
When I see you sky as a kite
As high as I might, I can't get that high
The how you move, the way you burst the clouds
It makes me want to try
And when I see you sticky as lips
As licky as trips, I can't lick that far
But when you pout, the way you shout out loud
It makes me want to start
And when I see you happy as a girl
That swims in a world of a magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through
To think I could've let you go

[Chorus]
And when I see you take the same sweet steps
You used to take, I say
""I'll keep on holding you in my arms so tight
I'll never let you slip away""

[Verse 2]
And when I see you kitten as a cat
Yeah, as smitten as that, I can't get that small
The way you fur, the how you purr
It makes me want to paw you all
And when I see you happy as a girl
That lives in a world of make believe
It makes me pull my hair all out
To think I could've let you leave

[Chorus]
And when I see you take the same sweet steps
You used to take, I know
I'll keep on holding you in my arms so tight
I'll never let you go",The Cure,Indie
36,Fire in Cairo,"[Verse 1]
Slowly fading blue, the eastern hollows
Catch the dying sun, the nighttime follows
Silence and black mirror pool
Mirrors a lonely place where I meet you

See your head in the fading light
And through the dark your eyes shine bright

And burn like fire, burn like fire in Cairo

Slide under my hand, sullen lips
Whisper my name and I yearn

37,Six Different Ways,"This is stranger than I thought
Six different ways inside my heart
And every one I'll keep tonight
Six different ways go deep inside

I'll tell them anything at all
I know I'll give them more and more

I'll tell them anything at all
I know I'll give the world and more

This time they're much too slow

Six sides to every lie I say

Not one of you is the same""

Six different ways inside my heart
And everyone I'll keep tonight
Six different ways go deep inside

Give me your eyes that I might see
The blind man kissing my hands
The sun is humming, my head turns to dust
As he plays on his knees
(As he plays on his knees)

[Chorus]
And the sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

And I laugh as I drift in the wind
Blind dancing on a beach of stone
Cherish the faces as they wait for the end
Sudden hush across the water
And we're here again

And the sand and the sea grows
I close my eyes
Move slowly through drowning waves
Going away on a strange day

And the sky and the impossible explode

An impression of sound
Then everything is gone forever

Yes, I know who you remind me of
A girl I think I used to know
Yes, I'd see her when the day got colder
On those days when it felt like snow

You know I even think that she stared like you
She used to just stand there and stare
And roll her eyes right up to heaven
And make like I just wasn't there

And she used to fall down a lot
That girl was always falling
Again and again
And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But I never even caught her name

And sometimes we would spend the night
Just rolling about on a floor
And I remember
Even though it felt soft at the time
I always used to wake up sore

You know I even think that she smiled like you
She used to just stand there and smile
And her eyes would go all sorts of far away
And stay like that for quite a while

That girl was always falling

And I used to sometimes try to catch her
But never even caught her name

A day without substance, a change of thought
An atmosphere that rots with time
Colors that flicker in water, a short term effect

Sideways across the desert, a charcoal face bites my hand

You expect me to act like a lover
Consider my moves and deserve the reward
To hold you in my arms and wait, and wait
And wait for something to happen

Then ran until I burst
I passed the howling woman
And stood outside your door

We walked around the lake
And woke up in the rain
And everyone turned over
Troubled in their dreams again

Visiting time is over
And so we walk away
And both play dead then cry out loud
Why we always cry this way?

I kissed you in the water
And made your dry lips sing
I saw you look like a Japanese baby
In an instant I remembered everything
Everything, everything, everything

I called you after midnight
Then ran until my heart burst
I passed the howling woman
And stood outside your door

I kissed you in the water
And made your dry lips sing
I saw you look like a Japanese baby
In an instant I remembered everything
Everything, everything, everything

Take me for the walk
Take me for the walk

49,Three Imaginary Boys,"[Verse 1]
Walk across the garden
In the footsteps of my shadow
See the lights out
No one's home
In amongst the statues
Stare at nothing in
The garden moves
Can you help me?

Close my eyes
And hold so tightly
Scared of what the morning brings
Waiting for tomorrow
Never comes
Deep inside
The empty feeling
All the night time leaves me

Slipping through the door
Hear my heart beats in the hallway
Echoes
Round and round
Inside my head
Drifting up the stairs
I see the steps behind me
Disappearing
Can you help me?

Close my eyes
And hold so tightly
Scared of what the morning brings
Waiting for tomorrow
Never comes
Deep inside
The empty feeling
All the night time leaves me
Three imaginary boys sing in my
Sleep sweet child
The moon will change your mind

See the cracked reflection
Standing still
Before the bedroom mirror
Over my shoulder
But no one's there
Whispers in the silence
Pressing close behind me
Pressing close behind
Can you help me?

Can you help me?
Can you help me?

0,Gunga Din,"[Verse 1]
Woke up again to my chagrin
Getting sick and tired of feeling sick and tired again
I tried to write, because I got the right
To make it look as if I'm doing something with my life
Got to find a vein, it's always the same
And a drink to ease the panic and the suffering
I woke up again
Dreamt of Gunga Din

Oh, the road is long
If you stay strong
You're a better man than I
You've been beaten and flayed
Probably betrayed
You're a better man than I

[Verse 2]
Woke up again to my evil twin
The mirror is fucking ugly and I'm sick and tired of looking at him
Been up all night, I'll probably pick a fight
'Coz I can't help it, I'm bastard in the morning
So I try to write, I think I have the right
A little drink-y now and then to help me just to see the light
Just another day, it feels like nothing's changed
Oh fuck it, oh here I go again

[Chorus]
Oh, the road is long
If you stay strong
You're a better man than I
You've been beaten and flayed
Probably betrayed
You're a better man than I

I can't chase you nohow
Oh, leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight from Sunday blues

You've been beaten and flayed
Probably betrayed

1,Heart of the Matter,"[Verse 1 ]
No one can hold a light to your misery
You’re the number one
Being hard done
Hard done by
You’ll get by with your smile
Wicked smile and laughing at the misfortune of others
You gotta get your kicks
Kicking the pricks
Laughing as they pick up sticks
And old ladies walks on by
Trip up as they glide

So hold a light to my misery
But don’t send it up in flames

But try me anyway

With your wicked little smile
You’ll get by, you’ll get by with your wicked little

2,Can’t Stand Me Now,"[Verse 1]
An ending fitting for the start
You twist'n'tore our love apart
Your light fingers threw the dart
That shattered the lamp and into darkness cast us

[Verse 2]
No, you've got it the wrong way round
You shut me up, and blamed it on the brown
Cornered the boy kicked out at the world
The world kicked back a lot fuckin' harder now

[Verse 3:]
Have we enough to keep it together?
Or do we just keep on pretending
And hope our luck is never ending now
You tried to pull the wool I wasn't feeling too clever
And you take all that they're lending
Until you needed mending now

[Pre-Chorus]
If you want to try
If you want to try
There's no worse you could do
Uh oh oh

I know you lie
All you do is make me cry

3,You’re My Waterloo,"[Peter Doherty]
You'll never fumigate the demons
No matter how much you smoke
So just say you love me
For three good reasons
And I'll throw you the rope

You don't need it
Because you are the survivor
Of more than one life
And you're the only lover I had
Who ever slept with a knife

But you're not Judy Garland
Oh just like me you've never really had a home of your own
But I'm not Tony Hancock baby
Until the dawn
We'll stone the crows
We'll stone the crows
We'll stone the crows

And you see I've brought you flowers
I've brought you flowers, all collected from the Old Vic Stage
Well I've been sitting here for hours, baby
Just chasing these words
Across the page

Cause you're my Waterloo
Well I'll be your Gypsy Lane
I'm so glad we know just what to do
And exactly who's to blame

And you're my Waterloo
I'll be your Stanley Park
Well I'm so glad we know just what to do
And no one's left
Stumbling around
Fumbling around
Tumbling around
In the dark

Always in the dark

You're my Waterloo
I'll be your Calvary
Well I'm so glad we know just what to do
And everyone's gonna be happy
Everyone's gonna be happy
Everyone's gonna be happy

But of course",The Libertines,Indie
4,Time for Heroes,"[Verse 1]
Did you see the stylish kids in the riot?
Shovelled up like muck and set the night on fire
Wombles bleed, truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love

[Verse 2]
But there's a rumour spread nasty disease around town
You caught round the houses with your trousers down
A headrush in the bush
You know I cherish you my love
Oh how I cherish you my love

[Chorus]
Tell me what can you want now you've got it all
The whole scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean

[Verse 3]
He knows it's eating, it's chewing me up
It's not right for young lungs to be coughing up blood
And it's all
It's all in my hands
And it's all up the walls

[Verse 4]
Well the stale chips are up and the hope stakes are down
It's all these ignorant faces that bring this town down
And I sighed and sunken with pride
Well I passed myself down on my knees
Yes I passed myself down on my knees

[Chrous]
Now tell me what can you want now you've got it all
The whole scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean

[Verse 5]
He knows there's fewer more distressing sights than that
Of an Englishman in a baseball cap
And we'll die in the class we were born
But that's a class of our own my love
A class of our own my love

[Verse 6]
Did you see the stylish kids in the riot
Shovelled up like muck
Set the night on fire
Wombles bleed truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love
Yeah I cherish you my love",The Libertines,Indie
5,Anthem for Doomed Youth,"[Verse 1]
Here's a story about the rules of death or glory
To be learned by heart by all children of men
It's the hour of the morning on the day after the dawning
When the sun they said would never set finally set again
Was it  Cromwell or Orwell who first led you to the stairwell
Which leads only forever to kingdom come
Rushed along by guiding hands whispers of the promised land
They wished you luck and handed you a gun

[Chorus]
Life could be so handsome
Life could be so gay
We're going nowhere
But nowhere, nowhere's on our way

[Verse 2]
In the pub that night
Racking out the lines of shite
Putting to right
All of the world's great wrongs
Yes we thought that they were brothers
Then they half-murdered each other
Then they did a karaoke turn
And murdered our best song

Told the governor's wife
About the last night of his life
She turned away in tears
Called you a liar
Where are all the old dreams now?
The batallions, once so proud
Lost in some old song and hanging on the old barbedwire

[Chorus]
Life could be so handsome
It's all gonna be okay
We're going nowhere
But nowhere, nowhere's on our way

[Verse 3]
Nowhere in the institutions
Did they teach that revolution
Was something that could ever come to pass
Oh we tried one, once before
Was the king's head on the floor
And we got booted out the boozer
Cause someone smashed the glass

[Chorus]
Life could be so handsome
Life could be okay
We're going nowhere
But nowhere, nowhere's on our way

Life could be so handsome
It's all gonna be okay
We're going nowhere
Cause nowhere, nowhere's on our way

Nowhere's on our way",The Libertines,Indie

7,Music When the Lights Go Out,"Is it cruel or kind not to speak my mind
And to lie to you rather than hurt you?
Well, I'll confess all of my sins
After several large gins
But still I'll hide from you
Hide what's inside from you

And alarm bells ring
When you say your heart still sings
When you're with me
Oh, won't you please forgive me?
I no longer hear the music
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

And though the memories of the pubs
And the clubs and the drugs and the tubs
We shared together
Will stay with me forever

But all the highs and the lows
And the to's and the fro's
They left me dizzy
Oh, won't you please forgive me

I no longer hear the music
Oh, no, no, no, no
Well, I no longer hear the music when the lights go out
Love goes cold in the shades of doubt
The strange fate in my mind is all too clear


Music when the lights come on
The girl I thought I knew has gone
And with her my heart had disappeared
Well I no longer hear the music
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

All the memories of the fights and the nights
And the blue lights, all the kites
We flew together
I thought they'd fly forever

But all the highs and the lows
And the to's and the fro's
They left me dizzy
Oh, won't you forgive me

I no longer hear the music
Well, I no longer hear the music
I no longer hear the music
When the lights go out
Love goes cold in the shades of doubt

8,Don’t Look Back Into the Sun,"Yeah!
Don’t look back into the sun
Now you know that the time is come
And they said it would never come for you oh oh oh oh

Oh my friend you haven’t changed
You're looking rough and living strange
And I know you got a taste for it too oh oh oh

They'll never forgive you but they won't let you go (oh no)
She'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no!

Don't look back into the sun
You've cast your pearls but you're on the run
And all the lies you said, who did you save?

But when they played that song at the Death Disco
It started fast but it ends so slow
And all the time just reminded me of you

They'll never forgive you but they won't let you go (let me go!)
She'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no!",The Libertines,Indie
9,Up the Bracket,"[Verse 1]
I saw two shadow men on the Vallance Road
They said they'd pay me for your address
Oh, I was so bold

I said you see these two cold fingers
These crooked fingers I show
You as a way to mean no

Well they didn't like that much I can tell you
Said ""Sunshine, I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes""
Then they chased me up threeflights of stairs
Caught me in the lift how I sighed and said
""Hello,"" but you're impossible

[Chorus]
And it's just like he's in another world
He doesn't see the danger on show
Now he'll wind up like Joseph, bloody in a hole

It's just like she's in another world
You know they suit each other oh no
Cause you never get close
It's impossible

[Verse 2]
Saw the same two men on the Cally Road
Said now they double their offer
I was so bold

To say ""You see these two cold fingers I know
These crooked fingers I show
Oh you's a way to mean no""

[Chorus]
But it's just like he's in another world
He doesn't see the danger on show
And he'll end up like Joseph, bloody in a hole

It's just like she's in another world
And now they suit each other oh no
But you never get close

We walk the streets of London
Looking for the crossroads everywhere
Holed up in squats in theatre bars
There’s a slasher on the Holloway boulevard

Walking the streets of London
Looking for the crossroads everywhere

11,Death On the Stairs,"[Verse 1]
From way far across the sea
Came an Eritrean maiden she
Had a one-track mind and eyes for me
Half blinded in a war
With a pale, young Anglican
Who said he'd help her all he can
Showed her Jesus and his little unholy friend
She had no mind to please him
Just say 'ta-ra' and leave him behind

[Verse 2]
A little boy in a stairwell who
Says 'I hate people like you'
I got matchsticks and cable TV
Half of less than 50P
We all clambered over the balcony
Banging on the window, waking Steve
Bringing with the true love his unholy friend
Singing, 'If you really need it
You just won't leave it behind'

[Chorus]
So baby please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
But don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
Just don't bang on about yesterday
You know I wouldn't know about that anyway

[Verse 3]
Monkey asked to the mouse before
If she loved anybody more than he
Turns you into stone
Now I'm reversing down the lonely street
Cheap hotel where I can meet the past
Pay it off and keep it sweet
(aw) It's sweet and it's nothing, no
It's just like nothing at all

[Verse 4]
You know I've seen you there
How could I help but stare?
It rips the heart out of your baby
I've taken too far too much to see or think or touch what's real
Stranded on this street that paved my only way home
If you really need it all
You just won't leave him behind

[Chorus]
Oh please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
Don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
And don't try joke about yesterday
You know I wouldn't know about that anyway

If Queen Boadicea is long dead and gone
Still then the spirit
In her children's children's children
It lives on

[Verse 1]
If you've lost your faith in love and music
Oh the end won't be long
Because if it's gone for you then I too may lose it
And that would be wrong

I've tried so hard to keep myself from falling
Back into my bad old ways
And it chars my heart to always hear you calling
Calling for the good old days
Because there were no 'good old days'
These are the good old days

[Bridge]
It's not about, tenements and needles
And all the evils in their eyes
And the backs of their minds
Daisy chains and school-yard games
And a list of things we said we'd do tomorrow
A list of things we said we'd do tomorrow

[Verse 2]
The Arcadian dream has all fallen through
But the Albion sails on course
So let's man the decks and hoist the rigging

And now they're coming out in droves
Out of the burrows to the shows

All I want is to scream out loud
And have it up with a mental crowd

Here's to the thug you can't cultivate
Working his scrubs by the prison gate
Your mum, your son in law and your lonely nights too
They boxed off your heart, you boxed out your mind

Go on and tell him everything you know
Tell him you know how I feel
Tell him you know how I feel at the palace gates

And just to work out what it's on about
I can see snakes in eyes
And danger signs

If you were late
You mustn't dare complain
Oh, you won't like this at all
There's nothing to break your fall

Until I'm levered off my face
And I can work out what she's on about

Following your mind's instructions
On how to just slowly, sharply screw myself to death

Oh yes, there is a screw
And it's pointed at my head
It's pointing at you

And would you lay me down please let me down
Pin me up or put me down
Oh oh oh oh now I let it go

19,Dead for Love,"[Verse 1]
Your only rule]
And everything he ever did
He only ever did for love
Everything he ever said
Was only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead
He’s dead for love
His mind’s at ease
He sleeps in peace

[Verse 2]
Your reflection in her eyes
You just don’t recognise
And soon you’ll realize
This guy’s not going anywhere
And now he’s done this, he wants more
Race with the shadows to the door
A guy like this needs to be shun
No one was there when the devil rode out before

[Chorus]
And everything he ever did
He only ever did for love
Everything he ever said
He only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead
He’s dead for love
His mind’s at ease
He sleeps in peace

[Bridge]
And in the shadows your will walk tall
And there you’ll stay until you fall
And when the final hour arrives
It's only lovers left alive
Wretched souls and gangsters’ molls
Beyond the valley of the dolls
Your story they will never tell
Because their lips are sealed

[Chorus]
And everything you ever did
You only ever did for love
And everything you ever said
You only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead
He’s dead for love
Your mind’s at ease
You sleep in peace
And everything you ever did
You only ever did for love
And everything you ever said
You only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead
He’s dead for love
Your mind’s at ease
You sleep in peace

[Outro]
After a sleepless night the body weakens
It grows dear, not ones own, it's nobody's
Sluggish, the veins still retain the ache of arrows
One smiles to all with a seraph's ease

Lips glow softly, the shadow's were golden
Under sunken eyes
Night has set ablaze
The most radiant countenance
And dark nights renders
But one part of us dark - the eyes",The Libertines,Indie

If I have to go
I will be thinking of your love
Oh somehow you'll know

Oft times his mind told himself was bliss
Acousticalullaby with all hell going on inside
It was a trench-coat top hat shotgun dog down day

It was a sound a bit like this
Trashy and blue with a blaggard's hiss
Singing about gits love today
In a strung up hang dog head fuck quick buck way

Packed up and I headed East
Headed for the Belly of the Beast
But within a Bangkok's half hour
I was way laid by a lower power
It was a smacked up cracked up bone shot smacked down day

Don't know if I can go on
Making no sense in songs
Don't know if this is forever
It sometimes feels like forever
Forever and a dog down day

Git was found in a state like this
By town on a hammock with a bloodied fist
His heart was broke but he got the gist
Git he can't carry on like this
It was a blackjack, paddy-whack, stick a brother in the back day

Back in London’s grey-scotch mist
Staring up at my therapist
He says pound for pound, blow for blow
You’re the most messed-up mother-fucker I know
It was a 12 step bus fare knock down daycare day

Makes no odds that you're there
Makes no odds that you care
Makes no odds any more

Forever and a dog down
Forever and a dog down day

Don't know if I can go own
Making no sense in songs
Forever and a dog down day

Is this failing?
Supposed to be plain sailing
Don't fade away
Don't fade away

Cause I don't always wanna see you

The only thing that kept us apart
Was your cold unloving heart
Cold, cold heart

At the start of the part of the scene?
Came apart at the seems
A dream shared and pulled apart
One dream broken by two Libertines

You think it's easy?
Not with a best friend who deceives me, no
Oh it ain't so hard to bear
When he got Kathmandu hair, cunt

The only thing that kept it going on
Was lust for Schnapples, whiskey and song

Clouds of smoke he sought to find his dreams
Suedehead and his pipe he wove through the white city

Struggling with life love and money
Weaving through the streets and looking so so pretty

He met her on the first day of December
Outside a a bookshop on the Charing Cross road

He'd chain-smoke and she'd stare up at the sky
And say this life, this love, this river has to end

But still it's better to be shy than screaming drunken old queen who's always
Has to have his way
But don't be coy with me I'm too clever to follow you down
To the dark and stormy weather, babe
The bracket's wider now
So what's your pleasure?
Swallow your pride but please

[Chorus]
Don't be shy
Don't be shy
If you are shy for tomorrow you'll be shy for 1,000 days

Now is your time to shine
Dance and hear your song
Or you may wake up one day in the last chance saloon
To find your last chance has been and gone

[Chorus]
Don't be shy
Don't be shy
For if you are shy for tomorrow you'll be shy for 1000 days",The Libertines,Indie

We find them all burst
Where degenerate kings, pushy beggars
Fallen ladies of letters and verse
Pride, lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath and envy

And I, I pay no mind

To a name that you will employ me
I despise all their kind
Job search and destroy me

Hand me my gun
My friend we'll have some fun
Shoot down the spies in the trees
And kick up the leaves
In the morning breeze
Pay no mind

Still ring in the old machine
And chain me to hell

Its obscene stay home and get lean
Live in your mind but don't live in your dreams

On the Albion-ay
Spew it out your soul

You wake a slave you squandered
So your soul is not your own
I run from the dust and gloom
With only my secrets to keep me warm
That's all I could do to keep them from you
And its all a pact we swore

Raise your glasses
Drink a toast to the ruling classes

Spew it out your soul

All night long we were singing Northern songs

Yes I do love every single inch of you
But doesn't she get that warm glow inside?
Shoots up your spine and blows through your mind

You've always wanted one slice more
Than you and me

Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between archers
Her very Lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry but it sounds like a wonderful thing
I say Charles don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?

And so I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendent
Of some old queen or other
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Oh has the world changed, or have I changed?
Some nine year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to God, I swear I never even knew what drugs were

So I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner

We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty
(These are the things that kill me)
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair
(These are the things that kill me)
All their lies about makeup and long hair, are still there

Past the pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money

Pass the pub that wrecks your body
And the church, all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb

They were born, and then they lived, and then they died
Seems so unfair, I want to cry

If you must write prose and poems the words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take ""on loan""

And who trips you up and laughs when you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh when you fall

Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way, and it corrodes my soul
I want to leave, you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, I'm a sickening wreck
I've got the twenty-first century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history, Mr. Shankly

[Verse 2]
Fame, fame, fatal fame
It can play hideous tricks on the brain
But still I'd rather be famous
Than righteous or holy, any day, any day, any day
But sometimes I'd feel more fulfilled
Making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to live and I want to love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of

[Verse 3]
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way, and it corrodes my soul
Oh, I didn't realise that you wrote poetry
I didn't realise you wrote such bloody awful poetry, Mr. Shankly
Frankly, Mr. Shankly, since you ask
You are a flatulent pain in the arse
I do not mean to be so rude
Still, I must speak frankly, Mr. Shankly

I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith...

It is murder
And the turkey you festively slice
It is murder
Do you know how animals die?

It's not comforting, cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench of murder

No, no, no, it is murder

Anything to happen to her)
Would you please let me see her!

35,Stop Me If You Think You’ve Heard This One Before,"[Chorus]
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only
Slightly, only slightly less
Than I used to, my love

[Verse 1]
I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, Buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? I never!
Who said I'd lied because I never?

[Verse 2]
I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my spleen
And broke my knee
(and then he really laced into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied? - Because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied? - Because I never
Oh, so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor...
... I drank more

[Chorus]
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
... Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love",The Smiths,Indie

37,Nowhere Fast,"[Verse 1]
I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means (of slender means)
Each household appliance is like a new science in my town

[Refrain 1]
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean

[Chorus]
And when a train goes by it's such a sad sound
It's such a sad thing

[Verse 2]
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
Every sensible child will know what this means
The poor and the needy are selfish and greedy on her terms

[Refrain 1]
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean

[Chorus]
And when a train goes by it's such a sad sound
It's such a sad thing

[Verse 3]
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life and I think about death
And neither one particularly appeals to me

[Refrain 2]
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
In the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die",The Smiths,Indie
38,Vicar in a Tutu,"[Verse 1]
I was minding my business
Lifting some lead off
The roof of the Holy Name church
It was worthwhile living a laughable life
To set my eyes on the blistering sight

[Chorus]
Of a Vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

[Verse 2]
A scanty bit of a thing
With a decorative ring
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose
As Rose collects the money in a canister
Who comes sliding down the bannister?

[Chorus]
A vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way

[Verse 3]
The monkish monsignor
With a head full of plaster
Said ""My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned""
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again
My God!

[Chorus]
The Vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh...
The Vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh...

[Verse 4]
The next day in the pulpit
With freedom and ease
Combatting ignorance, dust, and disease
As Rose counts the money in the canister
As natural as rain
He dances again and again and again

[Outro]
In the fabric of a tutu
Any man could get used to
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign
And I am the living sign",The Smiths,Indie

Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well

Bought on stolen wine
Oh, a nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next

Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say]

I know I'm unloveable
You don't have to tell me
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours
I don't have much in my life but take it - it's yours

41,Rusholme Ruffians,"[Verse 1]
The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed and his money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
She is famous, she is funny
An engagement ring doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass money

[Chorus]
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

[Verse 2]
The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait on her mother's side
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait on her mother's side

[Chorus]
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

[Verse 3]
Then someone falls in love
And someone's beaten up, someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And someone falls in love
And someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine

[Chorus]
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout

[Verse 4]
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said]
So scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(This means you really love me)
Scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(This means you really love me)

[Chorus]
And though I walk home alone
I just might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout",The Smiths,Indie
42,Rubber Ring,"[Verse 1]
A sad fact widely known
The most impassionate song to a lonely soul
Is so easily outgrown
But don't forget the songs that made you smile
And the songs that made you cry
When you lay in awe on the bedroom floor
And said ""oh, oh, smother me mother""
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di la da da dey di

[Verse 2]
The passing of time and all of its crimes
Is making me sad again
The passing of time and all of its sickening crimes
Is making me sad again
But don't forget the songs that made you cry
And the songs that saved your life
Yes, you're older now and you're a clever swine
But they were the only ones who ever stood by you

[Verse 3]
The passing of time leaves empty lives waiting to be filled
The passing of time leaves empty lives waiting to be filled
I'm here with the cause, I'm holding the torch
In the corner of your room (can you hear me?)
And when you're dancing and laughing and finally living
Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly
Oh, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh na na na, la da dey, la da dey, la da dey
Oh la day, la da da dey di, la da da dey di

43,The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,"[Verse 1]
Please don't cry
For the ghost and the storm outside
Will not invade this sacred shrine
Nor infiltrate your mind
My life down I shall lie
If the bogey-man should try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
To tease, torment, and tantalize
Wavering shadows loom
A piano plays in an empty room
There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
And when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
For you are all that matters
And I'll love you till the day I die
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Ceiling shadows shimmy by
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wondrous eyes
My life down I shall lie
Should restless spirits try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
I once had a child, and it saved my life
And I never even asked his name
I just looked into his wondrous eyes
And said: ""Never never never again""
And all too soon I did return
Just like a moth to a flame
So rattle my bones all over the stones
I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
Oh, see how words as old as sin
Fit me like a glove
I'm here and here I'll stay
Together we lie, together we pray
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Mine
Climb up on my knee, sonny boy
Although you're only three, sonny boy
You're - you're mine
And your mother she just never knew
Oh, your mother...
As long... as long... as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
As long... as long... as long as... as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her

44,Miserable Lie,"So, goodbye
Please stay with your own kind
And I'll stay with mine

There's something against us
It's not time
It's not time
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I know I need hardly say
How much I love your casual way
Oh, but please put your tongue away
A little higher and we're well away
The dark nights are drawing in
And your humour is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
And ""love"" is just a miserable lie
You have destroyed my flower-like life
Not once - twice
You have corrupt my innocent mind
Not once - twice
I know the wind-swept mystical air
It means : I'd like to see your underwear
I recognise that mystical air
It means: I'd like to seize your underwear
What do we get for our trouble and pain ?
Just a rented room in Whalley Range
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
...Whalley Range!
Into the depths of the criminal world

I need advice, I need advice
Nobody ever looks at me twice

47,I Started Something I Couldn’t Finish,"[Verse 1]
The lanes were silent
There was nothing, no one, nothing around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
With a hard-faced
Three-word gesture

[Chorus]
I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me
Typical me
I started something
...And now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means

And I doused another venture
With a gesture
That was... absolutely vile

I started something
I forced you to a zone
And you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted

I started something

49,These Things Take Time,"[Verse 1]
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wunderkind
You took me behind a disused railway line
And said, ""I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known""
And then you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

[Chorus]
But these things take time
And I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stepped

[Verse 2]
I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
And the hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going
And you know where you belong
You said I was ill and you were not wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And so you never care

[Chorus]
But these things take time
And I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stepped

Oh, the alcoholic afternoons
When we sat in your rooms
They meant more to me than any
Than any living thing on earth
It had more worth
Than any
Living thing on earth, on earth, on earth

Your pink fat lips let go a scream
You fry and melt, I love the scene

Sometimes I fantasise
When the streets are cold and lonely
And the cars they burn below me

When the streets are cold and lonely
And the cars they burn below me
Are you all alone?
Is anybody home?

I’m standing warm against the cold
Now that the flames have taken hold
At least you left your life in style
And for as far as I can see
Ten twisted grills grin back at me
Bad money dies, I love the scene

Today’s the day she’s sworn
To steal what she never could own
And race from this hole she calls home

Now you’re at the wheel
Tell me how, how does it feel?
So good to have equalised
To lift up the lids of your eyes

As the miles they disappear
See land begin to clear
Free from the filth and the scum
This American satellite's won

She’ll carry on through it all
She’s a waterfall
She’ll carry on through it all
She’s a waterfall

See the steeple pine
The hills as old as time
Soon to be put to the test
To be whipped by the winds of the west

Stands on shifting sands
The scales held in her hands
The wind it just whips her away
And fills up her brigantine sails

She’ll carry on through it all
She’s a waterfall
She’ll carry on through it all
She’s a waterfall",The Stone Roses,Indie

7,Bye Bye Badman,"[Verse 1]
Soak me to my skin
Will you drown me in your sea
Submission ends and I begin
Choke me, smoke the air
In this citrus sucking sunshine
I don’t care, you’re not all there

Every backbone and heart you break
Will still come back for more
Submission ends it all

[Chorus]
Here he comes
Got no questions, got no love
I’m throwing stones at you man
I want you black and blue and
I’m gonna make you bleed
Gonna bring you down to your knees
Bye bye badman
Bye bye

[Verse 2]
Choke me smoke the air
In this citrus sucking sunshine
I don’t care, you’re not all there

You’ve been bought and paid
You’re a whore and a slave
You're a dark star, holy shrine
Come taste the end, you’re mine

[Chorus]
Here he comes
Got no questions, got no love
I’m throwing stones at you man
I want you black and blue and
I’m gonna make you bleed

I intend to knock you down

9,(Song For My) Sugar Spun Sister,"Her hair
Soft drifted snow
Death white
I’d like to know
Why she hates
All that she does
But she gives
It all that she’s got

Until the sky turns green
The grass is several shades of blue
Every member of Parliament trips on glue
Until the sky turns green
And the grass is several shades of blue
Every member of Parliament trips on glue

It takes all these things
And all that time
Till my sugar spun sister’s happy
With this love of mine
It’ll take all these things
And oh much more

I’ve paid
For fifteen or more
But my guts
Can’t take many more
My hands
Are stuck to my jeans
And she knows, she knows
What this must mean

She wakes up with the sun
She asked me what is all the fuss
As she gave me more than she thought she should
She wakes up with the sun
I think, what have I done?
As I gave her more than I thought I would

12,Mersey Paradise,"River splashes against the rocks
And I scale a slope, I hope the tracks won't
Lead me down to dark black pits
Or places where we fall to bits
If she were there I'd hold her down
I'll push her under while she drowns
And couldn't breathe and call for air
She doesn't care for my despair

Or is it me?
Or the one that's wrong
You see it in the sea
River Cool's where I belong
In my Mersey paradise

As I stare an oil wheel comes
Sailing by, and I feel like
Growing fins and falling in
With the bricks, the bikes, the rusty tin
I'll swim along without a care
I'm eating sand when I need air
You can bet your life I'll meet a pike
Who'll wolf me down for tea tonight

I want to be (I want to be)
Where the drownings are (drownings are)
You see it in the sea
River Cool's where I belong
In my Mersey paradise

I want to be (I want to be)

You know it
You show it
And the time has come to shoot you down
What a sound
When the day is done

I’d love to do it and you know you’ve always had it coming

I never wanted
The love that you showed me
It started to choke me
And how I wish I’d said No
Too slow
I couldn’t take that
Too fast
I want you to know

You know it
You show it
But I can’t back down
It’s far too late
I can’t wait

14,Elephant Stone,"[Verse 1]
Burst into heaven
Kiss in the cotton clouds
Arctic sheets and fields of wheat
I can't stop coming down
Your shrunken head
Looking down on me above
Send me home like an elephant stone
To smash my dream of love
Dreaming till the sun goes down
And night turns into day
Rooms are empty I've got plenty
You could move in right away

[Chorus 1]
Seems like there's a hole
In my dreams
In my dreams
In my dreams

[Verse 2]
Down through the heavens
Choke on the cotton clouds
Arctic sheets and fields of wheat
I can't stop coming down
Your shrunken head
Looking down on me above
Send me home like an elephant stone
To smash my dream of love
Didn't your bed and bookshelf go
And run run run away
These four walls saw the rise and fall
And your midnight getaway

[Chorus 2]
Seems like there's a hole
In my dreams
Or so it seems
Yet nothing means anything
Anymore",The Stone Roses,Indie

Hear the sea spray give
I was with her
We’re under the ship so get me over
Now that was me
Listen
Now she fishes
Now listen
There was no-one out there we used
It's the news for me
Useless
Now so much waste
How we’ll be teased

Don’t stop
Isn’t it funny how you shine?
Don’t stop
Isn’t it funny how you shine?

16,Going Down,"Dawn sings in the garden
Phone sings in the hall
This boy's dead from two days life
Resurrected by the call
Penny here we've got to come
So come on round to me
There's so much, Penny, lying here
To touch, taste and tease
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding, I'm going down
I'm coming 'round

Penny's place a crummy room
Her dansette crackles to Jimi's tune
I don't care, I taste Ambre Solaire
Her neck, her thighs, her lips, her hair
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding, I'm going down
I'm coming 'round

All thoughts of sleep desert me
There is no time (there is no time)
Thirty minutes brings me round to
Her number 9

There she looks like a painting
Jackson Pollock's No. 5
Come into the forest and taste the trees
The Sun starts shining, and I'm hard to please
Ring-a-ding-ding-ding, I'm going down
I'm coming 'round

All thoughts of sleep desert me
There is no time (there is no time)
Thirty minutes brings me round to
Her number 9

To look down on the clouds
You don't need to fly
I've never flown in a plane
I'll live until I die",The Stone Roses,Indie
17,Ten Storey Love Song,"[Verse 1]
When your heart is black and broken
And you need a helping hand
When you're so much in love

When your questions go unanswered
And the silence is killing you
Take my hand baby I'm your man
I got loving enough for two

Ten storey love song
I built this thing for you
Who can take you higher than twin peak mountain blue?
Oh well, I built this thing for you
And I love you true

[Verse 2]
There's no sure-fire set solutions
No shortcut through the trees
No breaching the wall that they put there to keep you from me

As you're lying awake in this darkness
This everlasting night
Some day soon don't know where or when
You're gonna wake up and see the light

Ten storey love song
I built this thing for you
Who can take you higher than twin peak mountain blue?
Oh well, I built this thing for you

18,All Across The Sands,"Bones of an impressive romance
Scattered all across the sands
A secret safe with all the world
Too vain to seem so capable

Can you hear it calling
Do you feel warmer
As the hired hand's exposed

How can a pretty painted shell
Send them all packing off to Hell
A freight train laughs and rattles by
You kissed the girls and made them die

Can you hear it calling
Do you feel warmer
As the hired hand's exposed

And I'll never come here again
And we will never come here again
And we will never play here again
Again

Can you hear it calling
Do you feel warmer
As the hired hand's exposed

After her call
After her call
After her call
And she calls",The Stone Roses,Indie

A million miles from here where no one's ever been

Now I'm freezing with this company
Can't find my friends
Where can they be?

The lights lit up a thousand homes
The neon signs were blinking out
But no one heard me as I fight

I couldn't see, sand in my eyes
The noise I made drowned out the tide
But no one came I was all alone

The shadows crept along the beach
And now the buoy was out of reach
My lungs filled up with salt and screams

All alone on my own
Dark and cold wanting warmth
Fighting waves, that kept me from the shore

I climbed and fell and tried again
I slipped and tripped and fell back in
As thunder claps came across the sky
My screams were drowned out, so were I

So true love
Let me die, Jesus, Jesus, let me die
Drop the sky, let me die

This is the end, my end

All dressed up for dinner looked so fine
Your shining silver salver so tastefully powdered
With the finest military quick lime
Now try and picture this as I gave you a kiss
The apple in your mouth slipped in mine
The orchestra played the sweetest serenade
We laughed as we put away your wine

So raise your glasses here's a toast to wasted lives
May all their ghosts come back to haunt you
And tell you how they died

How do you sleep?
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay?
How do you feel when you close your eyes and try and drift away?
Does it feel any better now?
Does it mean anymore when the angel of death
Comes knock-knocking and banging at your door?

When all the fun was over
I put you on my shoulder
Took you home away from it all
Shot down and claimed
Mounted and framed
Tastefully hung upon my wall

Are my dreams your nightmares?
I hope they all come true
Get off your knees
The party's over
I'm coming home to you

How do you sleep?
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay?
How do you feel when you close your eyes and try and drift away?
Does it feel any better now?
Does it mean anymore when the angel of death
Comes knock-knocking and banging at your door?

To be whipped by the winds of the west
Stands on shifting sands

It's never yours but someone else's voice
And now you've seen that

Psychos in disguise

Darling, ain't nobody gonna tell us
They're gonna be oh so jealous
We're gonna be oh so silent
They're gonna be stoned in silence

(Ask anybody, baby)
(Is anyone asking maybe?)
(Can anyone even hear me?)

Why are you waiting beyond the door?

Life turns to dust
And rain turns to rust
Gossip is a truth
And money pays for the lies we trust
Your love is a surprise
Homeless saints are in disguise

There's no one I disapprove of more or root for more than myself
I wanted to pretend that it was better, better, better on the phone
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous and alone

So we talk about ourselves in hell
To forget the love we never felt
All the old jokes that work so well
Universal truth was a moment's lie

Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Get out of the way

Got to get to climb your tree in the light of the living ghost I see
She sees her father in that old man's eyes while secretly he stares at her thighs
Animals on TV singing about some pain they felt at some point
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous, what's the point?

As I watch the velvet drapes appear
And the door was closed for forty years
As we hide what we don't wanna hear
As we hide what's really in our ears

He is coming from a part of hell
Where lightning blue eyes don't go down well
He can tell that we're oblivious
It's addiction of routine as well
Making fools out of the best of us
Making robots of the rest of us
Innocence itself in America today
Is a crime just like Cornel West might say

Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us

I think I know what you mean, but watch what you say
'Cause they'll be trying to knock you down in some way
Sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep
How do you wake someone up from inside a dream?
Your mind would wander and search for its place in the night
Your body followed this feeling like following light
Once that your music was born, it followed you 'round
And then it gave your activities meaning and let you be loud

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sad but you smile, it's not in your eyes
Your eyeballs don't change, it's the muscles around your eyes

[Chorus]
An egg to fertilize, a pulse to stabilize
A body to deodorize, a life to scrutinize
A child to criticize, young adults to modernize
Citizens to terrorize, generations to desensitize

[Verse 2]
Your dreams are sweet and obsessed and you're overworked
You're over taken by visions of being overlooked
How disappointed would D.I.D.I.P.P. be
To see such our power in our hands all wasted on greed?
Am I a prisoner to instincts or do my thoughts just live
As free and detached as boats to the dock?
Just like the music was born and detached from your heart
Is your free time to free minds or for falling apart?

[Pre-Chorus]
Night after night, you turn off the light
You don't fall asleep right away, ""Are we, are we done?""

A market to monopolize, movie stars to idolize
Leaders to scandalize, enemies to neutralize

I bet you'd pick it up and mess around with it if I put it down

Whether I'm in your arms or I'm at your feet
I know exactly what you're thinking
You won't say it now, but in your heart it's loud

""Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours
Oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry,"" there you go

The world is in your hands or it's at your throat

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you take a walk outside? Oh, no
Can't you find some other guy? Oh, no
One-nine-six-nine, what's that sound? Oh, no
Keeping down the underground, oh, no

[Chorus]
The end has no end, the end has no end
The end has no end, the end has no end

[Verse 2]
He want it easy, he want it relaxed
Said, ""I can do a lot of things, but I can't do that""
Two steps forward then three steps back, it won't be easy

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you take a walk outside? Oh, no
Can't you find another guy? Oh, no
One-nine-six-three, what's that sound? Oh, no
Keeping down the underground, oh, no

The end has no end, the end has no end
The end has no end, the end has no end
The end has no end, the end has no end

46,Partners in Crime,"[Verse 1]
I forgot your jacket outdoors
Day's been something
See if I care
One; it's not okayish day, just so
But yes, if you insist
Okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, alright, I know where tonight

[Chorus]
Hey there, how goes it?
Any time they're closing?
Might need a lawyer
Let's all be honest
Where there's a forest
We don't belong

[Verse 2]
Pleased to get who's standing around
Life forgives you when you rebound
See my friend locked up at the zoo
Why aren't we leaving town right now?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, alright, I know where tonight

[Chorus 2]
I'm on the guestlist
We got the door, but
Can't seem to find it
Pants on a tiger
Winter is white and
I won't be here buzzing

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well, leaving your tears alone
Runs down your face and escapes

[Chorus 3]
Hey there, how goes it?
Any time they’re closing
You’ll need a lawyer
Let’s all be honest
We’re in a forest
We don’t belong

I’m on the guestlist
No need to welcome
Can’t seem to find it
March to the war drum
Tigers have pants on
We have no guns
Thank you for staying
What are you saying?
I won’t forget",The Strokes,Indie

I don't wanna waste your time
I just wanna say
I've got to say

We worked hard, darlin'
We don't have no control
We're under control

48,Red Light,"[Verse 1]
Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Do it for the people that have died for your sake
An entire generation that has nothing to say
How'd you make your way to me?

[Verse 2]
Oh, let's say you made a deal with me
And I got your name and your home address
Oh, you're all trashed up with your big red belt
I would almost say that you might need help
I could drop you off at the next red light
If it don't make sense or it don't feel right
All the girls could never make me love them
The way I love you

[Verse 3]
Can't you see the sky is not the limit no more?
I can see the elevator crash through the floor
I can still see yesterday, sailing away
Seven billion people who got nothing to say
Are you coming on to me?

[Verse 4]
Well, I saw your face then I heard that song
It was so inviting, it hurt my bones
Well, it looks like you but your eyes are gray
And your hair is gone but your mind's okay
Yes, I like your smile but your forehead's cold
I don't want you to be afraid and go
I would cheat and lie and steal
Now I'll stay at home and kneel for you

[Bridge]
I was waiting for my baby to arrive right by my side
Oh, please, leave me alone tonight, forget the past

[Verse 5]
Two could be complete without the rest of the world
Oh, you know I said it just to get you to laugh
Do it for the people that have died for your sake
An entire generation of entertainers to blame
The light is red, the camera's on

[Verse 6]
Get yourself a lawyer and a gun
Hate your friend's new friends like everyone
Childhood's end can be so competitive
Oh, the sky's not the limit and you're never gonna guess what is, oh",The Strokes,Indie
49,50/50,"Why's she telling me the story of her life?
All the things you wanna kill will give you spite
And if you've taken all the prisoners inside
As they're doling out their wisdom in the fire

I will say!
I will say don't judge me!
I will say!
I will say don't judge me!
I wait on a darkened highway!
I wait on a darkened highway!

I can take as long as without looking by
Why's she telling me the story of her life
And if you've taken all the prisoners inside
As they've thrown all their wisdom in the fire

I will say!
I will say don't judge me!
I will say!
I will say don't judge me!
I wait on a darkened highway!
I wait on a darkened highway!
